Scavenging vertebrates provide integral ecosystem services through the removal of carrion; a crucial role in nutrient cycling and disease dynamics. To explore how anthropogenic processes may effect such services we investigated the effects of land use on scavenger community composition, abundance, efficiency and health. Scavenger community composition is altered with increasing land-use pressures, mammalian scavengers are unable to persist in highly degraded habitats and an increased abundance of Water monitors (V.s. macromaculatus) to fill the extirpated niche is observed. Contrary to previous research land-use has minimal effect on community efficiency and established areas of disturbance display similar carrion removal rates to areas unaffected by human activity. However active habitat change causes a decrease in biodiversity, abundance and efficiency of scavenger communities, the wider implications of this are yet fully understood.","A Masters thesis by Joshua Twining, 2015.",1,208

It was found that across heterogeneous habitat types, ecological functioning is maintained along a land- use gradient of intermediate logging. Within primary homogenous habitat types, ecological functioning is found to be significantly positively correlated to non-beetle above ground biomass.

Riparian reserves, areas of native forest along rivers, offer a way of managing the maintenance of native species and their associated ecological processes within agricultural landscapes. Using acoustic sampling the importance of riparian reserves for insectivorous bats (Chiroptera) in oil palm plantations was investigated by comparing bat activity, feeding activity and species composition in riparian zones in logged forest with that in established riparian reserves within oil palm plantations. I also investigated whether bat activity was associated with riparian habitat covariates to gain an insight into possible optimum characteristics of reserves for bats. The results show that bat activity and feeding activity did not vary between the two riparian types suggesting that that for insectivorous bats riparian reserves in oil palm support similar activity to that in logged forest. However, Constant Frequency species composition did vary between the two river types. Fewer of the forest-dwelling species Rhinolophus trifoliatus, Rhinolophus sedulus, Rhinolophus borneensis and Hipposideros ridleyi and a higher abundance of edge/open forest species Hipposideros galeritus and Hipposideros cervinus were found in oil palm riparian reserves. Canopy cover was a key habitat covariate in explaining variation in bat activity. Hence, my results show that riparian reserves sustain bat activity and provide foraging grounds for bats within an oil palm landscape, however the reserves may not provide large enough fragments of forest with sufficient complexity in vegetation structure to sustain the more vulnerable forest-dwelling species. Up to now, the possible benefits of riparian reserves have been poorly studied in Southeast Asia, therefore my results provide an insight into the extent of the ecological benefits these reserves may have in forest-agricultural landscapes.","A Masters thesis by Katherine Mullin, 2015.",3,149

Camera traps are quickly becoming a staple in the surveying of medium and large terrestrial mammals, but their application in the surveying of small mammals has yet to be established. This study aims to test the effectiveness of camera trapping in comparison to traditional live trapping techniques, and verify whether the relative abundance index 'camera trapping rate' can be used as a valid inference of species abundance. 2. Data was taken from 21 sites across the Kalabakan Forest Reserve and the Maliau Basin Conservation Area in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The small mammal community was sampled using two methods: baited steel mesh traps and camera traps. Density estimates of small mammal species were derived from the live trapping using the R package secr, and regressed against the camera trapping rate. The two methods were also compared for their ability to detect species and estimate species richness. 3. Live trapping methods detected more species, more often and at less cost than the camera trapping methods in the Bornean rainforest. There was no significant relationship between density estimates derived from the live traps and camera trapping rates across any species except the slender treeshrew. 4. Camera trapping rates cannot be used as a substitute for abundance estimates, until further development in technology and study design significantly improve their detection rate of small, terrestrial mammals. They may be useful in studies requiring only simple presence data, but may underestimate the community present.

I examined the growth, mortality and recruitment rates of seedlings in response to recruitment factors across a gradient of logging disturbance in humid tropical forests of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo to elucidate the physiological mechanisms at play. 3. Recruitment was inhibited by competitive interactions which were exacerbated by logging disturbance intensity. This relationship was only weakly observed when not considering the intermediary recruitment factors due to dierential impacts of selective logging on aspects of recruitment. 4. Synthesis.

Biodiversity loss threatens ecosystem function and the services these provide. In order to detect trends in biodiversity through time, and understand the efficacy of conservation policies, the creation of long-term biodiversity datasets are of paramount importance. However, the expensive and time consuming nature of collecting monitoring data means there are very few datasets that consider time-scales of a decade or greater. Despite increasing recognition of its importance in setting conservation priorities, even fewer consider biodiversity in terms of its phylogenetic components. Continuous acoustic recordings have the potential to facilitate the development of long-term biodiversity datasets. Evidence suggests that they can reduce costs, avoid invasive sampling and undertake continuous measurements in remote locations. Recent work has developed acoustic indices which summarise biodiversity using acoustic data. However, there is only limited understanding of how these reflect the temporal dynamics and phylogenetic diversity of tropical ecosystems. This study used acoustic data from the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project in Borneo, to examine the extent to which acoustic indices reflected phylogenetic diversity, and how well they can characterise daily variation in animal activity.

Phylogenetic diversity was compared to three acoustic dissimilarity indices using Mantel tests and Spearman's rank correlation. This revealed that there was no correlation between phylogenetic diversity and acoustic dissimilarity. The results suggest that in complex tropical ecosystems it is difficult to detect a phylogenetic signal in the acoustic indices. This is most likely due to factors such as habitat structure driving phylogenetic and acoustic divergence at different rates. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the difference between acoustic diversity and the time categories; dawn and dusk, across three different forest locations. Acoustic diversity was significantly greater at dawn than at dusk. However, there was no difference between the three locations examined. As a result, acoustic indices may be suitable to monitor temporal patterns of diversity in tropical soundscapes. However, the relationship of acoustic indices to species diversity requires further validation.","A Masters thesis by Leah Trigg, 2015.",8,243

An increasing human population is currently the greatest threat to global biodiversity, as large proportions of natural ecosystems are destroyed, fragmented and degraded to fuel a growing demand for resources. Tropical forests are home to 50% of the Earth's species and a large proportion of those are insects.

2. Insects play a vital role in many ecosystem functions such as pollination, herbivory and dung removal, whilst also being useful bio-indicators for ecosystem health. In ecological models it is often assumed that insect movement is a random process, despite a rapidly growing pool of literature to suggest otherwise.

3. Here we studied the communities of insects that fly above rivers in tropical forest of varying degradation in Sabah, Malaysia. Directional flight intercept traps sampled either insects flying along or across rivers. Insects were identified to order level.

4. A higher diversity of insects was found to fly across rivers compared to along rivers, with differing community compositions also present moving along these two vectors. We suggest that this is due to the river acting as a barrier to insect dispersal, rather than a highway, thus more terrestrial orders are predominantly found flying across rivers to minimize time spent over the water.","A Masters thesis by Joseph Williamson, 2015.",9,220

This study found that low elevation is only indicative of lower abundance for two species out of 15 assessed, while richness shows a slight increase at midelevations. Four distinct communities were identified, with one dominant at low altitudes, one at high altitudes, and the other two intermittently.

Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of above ground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo.We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62% of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map above ground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in above ground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.","Pfeifer, M., Kor, L., Nilus, R., Turner, E., Cusack, J., Lysenko, I., Khoo, M., Chey, V.

The microhabitat preferences of the invasive Rattus rattus and three native species of small mammal were examined in three dimensional space by combining the spool-and-line technique with a novel method for quantifying fine-scale habitat selection. These methods allowed the detection of significant differences for each species between the microhabitats used compared with alternative, available microhabitats that were avoided. Rattus rattus showed the greatest preference for heavily disturbed habitats, and in contrast to two native small mammals of the genus Maxomys, R. rattus showed high levels of arboreal behavior, frequently leaving the forest floor and traveling through the understory and midstory forest strata. This behavior may enable R. rattus to effectively utilize the complex three-dimensional space of the lower strata in degraded forests, which is characterized by dense vegetation. The behavioral flexibility of R. rattus to operate in both terrestrial and arboreal space may facilitate its invasion into degraded forests. Human activities that generate heavily disturbed habitats preferred by R. rattus may promote the establishment of this invasive species in tropical forests in Borneo, and possibly elsewhere. We present this as an example of a synergistic effect, whereby forest disturbance directly threatens biodiversity and indirectly increases the threat posed by invasive species, creating habitat conditions that facilitate the establishment of non-native fauna.","Loveridge, R., Wearn, O.

The effects of fragmentation on community composition have received more attention than the effects on ecological processes, particularly in the tropics. The extent to which populations from forest fragments move (spillover) into surrounding agricultural areas is of particular interest. This process can retain connectivity between populations and alter the rate of beneficial or detrimental ecological functions. We tested whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves), are sources of two functionally important invertebrate groups (dung beetles and scavenging ants) within oil palm plantations in Malaysia. We also assessed whether forest fragments enhance rates of associated ecosystem functions (dung and bait removal). We found that oil palm sites with and without adjacent riparian reserves had similar overall beetle and ant communities and functional rates. However, dung beetle species richness, abundance and diversity declined with distance from a riparian reserve, providing evidence for a weak spillover effect. In addition, dung beetle community metrics within a riparian reserve predicted corresponding values in adjacent oil palm areas. These relationships did not hold for dung removal, ant community metrics or bait removal. Taken together, our results indicate that although riparian reserves are an important habitat in their own right, under the conditions in which we sampled they have a limited role as sources of functionally important invertebrates. Crucially, our results suggest that contiguous habitat corridors are important for maintaining connectivity of invertebrate populations, as forest dependent species may not easily be able to disperse through the agricultural matrix.","Gray, C.L, Simmons, B.

This practice is an important source of timber, but there are concerns about its long-term sustainability and impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. However, logging impacts vary widely, making generalisation and, consequently, policy implementation, difficult. Recent syntheses of animal biodiversity have indicated that differences in logging intensity - the volume of wood removed ha−1 - might help to explain some of these disparities. In addition, it has widely been assumed that reduced impact logging (RIL) might minimise some of the negative effects of logging; though in practice, this has rarely been tested. To test the hypothesis that RIL reduces negative impacts of selective logging once intensity is controlled for, we used meta-analyses of selective logging impact studies, focusing specifically on (1) residual tree damage, (2) aboveground biomass and (3) tree species richness. Our results indicate that RIL appears to reduce residual tree damage when compared to conventional methods. However, changes in aboveground biomass were negatively related to logging intensity. Any effect of RIL, independent of logging intensity, was difficult to discern since it was carried out at relatively low intensities. Tree richness appeared to increase at low intensities but decreased at higher intensities and any effect of RIL was difficult to detect. Our results tentatively support the hypothesis that RIL reduces the negative impacts of logging on tree damage, but do not support suggestions that RIL reduces loss of aboveground biomass or tree species richness. However, this lack of support may be a result of the relative paucity of data on the topic. Based on our results, we suggest that better evidence is needed to assess the differences between the impacts of RIL and conventional logging. Studies that consider plot-level differences in logging intensity are required to fill this knowledge gap. In addition, there must be clarification of whether RIL is an inherently low intensity practice so that this can be factored into management.

Abstract: A new species of woolly horseshoe bat in the Rhinolophus trifoliatus species group is described from Sabah in Malaysian Borneo. Two specimens from Central and West Kalimantan, Indonesia are referred to this species. A fourth specimen from western Thailand is referable to this species but on the basis of ~10% genetic divergence at the cytochrome oxidase-I gene is described as a separate subspecies. Morphologically and acoustically the two subspecies are similar. With a forearm length of 52.90-54.70 mm, a skull length of 24.27-26.57 mm and a call frequency of 49.2-50.0 kHz, the new species overlaps in size and call frequency with the sympatric R. trifoliatus. However, it differs significantly in having a dark noseleaf and a uniformly dark brown pelage, resembling, but being intermediate in size between R. sedulus and R. luctus, which have a skull length of 18.99-20.17 and 26.35-32.07 mm, respectively. It also differs from R. trifoliatus in the shape and size of the rostral inflation. It can be distinguished from R. beddomei (forearm length 55.00-63.44 mm) and R. formosae (forearm length 53.85-62.40 mm), which are endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and Taiwan, respectively, by its relatively smaller body size. Acoustic and genetic data are included in the comparison between the species. Both character states support the conclusions based on morphology. Further surveys in intact evergreen forest together with a re-examination of museum specimens may reveal that this species is widespread in Southeast Asia.","Soisook, P., Struebig, M.

Understanding these impacts requires efficient ways to measure vegetation change over broad spatial and temporal scales. Leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass are preferred quantitative measures of variation in plant community structure. However, their accurate measurement requires destructive sampling, which can be impractical or inappropriate. Here we test whether semi-quantitative assessment of Braun-Blanquet vegetation cover scores is a reliable proxy for direct quantitative measures of LAI and above-ground biomass of differing plant growth forms (PGF) within tropical forests.Location: Six hundred square kilometre area of tropical lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia.

Methods: We sampled understorey rain forest plant communities across a disturbance gradient in 2 x 2 m plots at 301 locations.We used a modified Braun- Blanquet scale to estimate plant cover, destructively harvested all live aboveground biomass up to a height of 2 m, calculated the above-ground biomass of each species from separately processed stem and leaf fractions in each plot, and then calculated LAI using reference measures of specific leaf area for each species. For each of nine PGFs, we regressed LAI and biomass against the nine-point Braun-Blanquet ordinal transform scale (OTS) using linear mixed effects models.Results: We found a simple, uniform logarithmic scaling of LAI with increasing Braun-Blanquet cover classes that was consistent across most PGFs, and with slope estimates close to 1.0. By contrast, no simple scaling relationship was found for above-ground biomass, with most PGFs exhibiting an asymptotic relationship in which the Braun-Blanquet estimates across high cover scores provided almost no resolution of observed variation in empirical biomass measures.

Conclusions: We found that the Braun-Blanquet OTS provides a remarkably simple and accurate logarithmic scaling of LAI, but care should be taken in applying scaling rules uniformly across PGFs. In contrast, the Braun-Blanquet OTS shows a more complex relationship with plant above-ground biomass and we caution against its unconditional use for biomass estimation. The findings of this study should be broadly applicable to other ecosystems due to the heterogeneity of plant communities included in this work.","Timm F. Döbert, Bruce L. Webber, John B.

Here, we focus on oil palm, a rapidly expanding crop in the tropics and subject to frequent calls for increased intensification. One promoted strategy is to remove epiphytes that cover the trunks of oil palms, and we ask whether this treatment affects either biodiversity or yield. We experimentally tested this by removing epiphytes from four-hectare plots and seeing if the biodiversity and production of fruit bunches 2 months and 16 months later differed from equivalent control plots where epiphytes were left uncut. We found a species-rich and taxonomically diverse epiphyte community of 58 species from 31 families. Epiphyte removal did not affect the production of fresh fruit bunches, or the species richness and community composition of birds and ants, although the impact on other components of biodiversity remains unknown. We conclude that as they do not adversely affect palm oil production, the diverse epiphyte flora should be left uncut. Our results underscore the importance of experimentally determining the effects of habitat complexity on yield before introducing intensive methods with no discernible benefits.","Graham W.

Living trees take in carbon dioxide whereas dead and decaying ones release it. Understanding the proportion of both is important for determining whether a large area of forest is a source of carbon dioxide, or a 'sink' that helps to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Forestry, agriculture and land-use changes account for nearly 25 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, second only to the energy sector. New research led by Imperial College London on partially-logged tropical rainforests shows that these forests are emitting more carbon than assumed, because they contain a high proportion of dead wood. The study, published in Environmental Research Letters, reveals that in these forests dead wood can make up to 50 per cent of the biomass, the biological material found above ground.

In untouched forests, dead wood is created through natural processes and makes up less than 20 per cent of the total aboveground biomass. Previously, when estimating the carbon emissions from logged tropical rainforests, researchers have assumed that when live trees are cut down and moved out of the forest, the amount of dead wood is reduced proportionately.

However, the new research paints a clearer picture of the situation in selectively-logged forests where only high-value trees are removed. It shows that because selective logging leaves behind significant damage and tree debris, dead wood actually accounts for up to 50 per cent of the total aboveground biomass.

“I was surprised by how much of the biomass dead wood accounted for in badly logged forests,” said lead author Dr Marion Pfeifer from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial. “That such logged forests are not properly accounted for in carbon calculations is a significant factor. It means that a large proportion of forests worldwide are less of a sink and more of a source, especially immediately following logging, as carbon dioxide is released from the dead wood during decomposition.”

Selective logging is a growing trend in global forestry. “Selectively-logged tropical forests now make up about 30 per cent of rainforests worldwide. This means such global calculations are wrong at least 30 per cent of the time,” said Dr Pfeifer.

The researchers surveyed a large area in the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) site, a region of rainforest in Malaysian Borneo. One of the largest ecological experiments on the planet, SAFE takes advantage of the conversion of the region to oil palm plantation to assess the impact of change on the local ecosystems.

Dr Pfeifer and her colleagues assessed the deadwood contributions across a 'disturbance gradient' - a range of landscapes including pristine forest, logged forests of increasing severity, and oil palm plantation.

“This large and diverse landscape study provides a lot of field data backing up our research. We are confident in our conclusions,” said Dr Pfeifer. “However, more work needs to be done to apply the results to carbon emissions calculations, such as determining how fast the dead wood is decomposing.”","Marion Pfeifer, Veronique Lefebvre, Edgar Turner, Jeremy Cusack, MinSheng Khoo, Vun K Chey, Maria Peni and Robert M Ewers Environmental Research Letters Volume 10 Number 4",26,164

Invertebrates perform essential functions for the smooth running of the ecosystems in tropical forests. For example, creatures such as termites and millipedes help dead leaves decompose and release their nutrients back into the soil, and carnivorous ants and spiders act as predators of herbivorous invertebrates that would otherwise munch through all the foliage.

Nearly a half of all tropical rainforests worldwide have been logged, and this often causes heavy changes to the number and type of invertebrates, with many species being lost from the ecosystem.

New research led by biologists from Imperial College London, published in Nature Communications, has discovered that when invertebrate diversity declines, their vital functions can be carried out by other members of the ecosystem.

The result shows that rainforest ecosystems have a remarkable resilience to change. “Invertebrates are often thought of as the controllers of tropical forests, so it's surprising that people can upset their dominance to this level,” said lead author Dr Robert Ewers from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial.

Although the ecosystem can continue to function with vertebrates taking more of a leading role, Dr Ewers says the situation leaves rainforests vulnerable: “The forest will keep maintaining itself, but it will be much more susceptible to further change. Relying on vertebrates is a bad tactic - they are less diverse and vulnerable to new challenges such as land use change.”

For example, the switch to agricultural plots such as palm plantations would cause biodiversity to drop faster. “Knocking out one or two invertebrates might not be too bad, as there are many others to take their place, but knocking out one or two vertebrates could now be disastrous,” said Dr Ewers.

By excluding certain organisms from patches of both natural and logged tropical rainforest in Borneo, the team were able to determine their contribution to the ecosystem. They found that in logged forests, the essential activities were still carried out at approximately the same speed, but that invertebrates contributed much less.

For example, the overall rate of invertebrate predation in natural and logged rainforests was the same. However, invertebrates were responsible for only around 60 percent of the activity in logged forests, compared to nearly all of it in natural forests. Instead, birds and bats were responsible for preying on many more invertebrates in logged forests.

The same trend was seen for seed disturbance, a vital function that helps maintain tree diversity, which was taken up by small mammals such as mice and treeshrews. The decomposition of leaf litter also seemed to be unaffected by the lack of invertebrates, although this was not a function picked up by vertebrates. Instead, the researchers think the litter may have continued to decompose thanks to a changing microclimate or the activities of soil bacteria.","Robert M. Ewers, Michael J. W. Boyle, Rosalind A.

Each of the four species showed contrasting microhabitat preferences: M. surifer favoured increased canopy closure and intermediate ground and understorey vegetation cover; M. whiteheadi preferred increased ground vegetation cover and canopy height; L. sabanus favoured sites with larger amounts of coarse woody debris and less leaf litter; and R. rattus was associated with increased ground vegetation cover. Within logged forest, detection probabilities of the three native species did not vary significantly with level of patch disturbance, whereas that of the invasive R. rattus increased markedly in more degraded sites.

By-product mutualisms, in which benefits accrue as side effects of partner behaviour or morphology, are often non-specific and hence may persist in novel ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis for a two-way by-product mutualism between epiphytic ferns and their ant inhabitants in the Bornean rain forest, in which ants gain housing in root-masses while ferns gain protection from herbivores. Specifically, we assessed how the specificity (overlap between fern and ground-dwelling ants) and the benefits of this interaction are altered by selective logging and conversion to an oil palm plantation habitat. We found that despite the high turnover of ant species, ant protection against herbivores persisted in modified habitats. However, in ferns growing in the oil palm plantation, ant occupancy, abundance and species richness declined, potentially due to the harsher microclimate. The specificity of the fern-ant interactions was also lower in the oil palm plantation habitat than in the forest habitats. We found no correlations between colony size and fern size in modified habitats, and hence no evidence for partner fidelity feedbacks, in which ants are incentivised to protect fern hosts. Per species, non-native ant species in the oil palm plantation habitat (18 % of occurrences) were as important as native ones in terms of fern protection and contributed to an increase in ant abundance and species richness with fern size. We conclude that this by-product mutualism persists in logged forest and oil palm plantation habitats, with no detectable shift in partner benefits. Such persistence of generalist interactions in novel ecosystems may be important for driving ecosystem functioning.","Tom M. Fayle, David P. Edwards, William A. Foster, Kalsum M. Yusah, Edgar C.

Ants, an important ecological group, often interact competitively to form mosaic-like patterns in disturbed plantation habitats, in which dominant species form mutually exclusive territories. However, the existence of these ant mosaics in pristine forests is contentious. Here we assess the relative strengths of ant competitive interactions in oil palm plantation and primary rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia, using null models of species co-occurrence. We use two metrics: the C-score, which measures mean degree of overall co-occurrence, and a novel metric, the C var -score, which measures the variance in degree of co-occurrence. We also investigate the role of nest sites by collecting ants from canopy and leaf litter microhabitats, and from epiphytic ferns, an important nest site for canopy ants. Furthermore, we assess whether non-native species, which were widespread in oil palm plantation (61 occurrences vs fi ve in rain forest) are important in driving the formation of ant mosaics. We found no evidence for ant mosaics in any primary forest microhabitat. In oil palm plantation, segregation between species was pronounced in epiphytes, weak in the rest of the canopy and absent in leaf litter communities. Intriguingly, exclusion of non-native ant species from analyses increased the degree of negative species co-occurrence in all three microhabitats, with species segregation in the oil palm canopy becoming statistically signifi cant. Our results suggest that invasion of plantation habitats by non-native species does not drive increased species segregation in ant communities. Rather, high degrees of species segregation might relate to changes in the importance of canopy nest sites, with colonies competing more strongly for these in plantations. In primary forests, weaker nest-site limitation and the highly complex, more vertically stratifi ed, non-uniform canopy could lead to random co-occurrence between ant species at the scales studied here.","Tom M.

The expansion of oil palm plantations at the expense of tropical forests is causing declines in many species and altering ecosystem functions. Maintaining forest-dependent species and processes in these landscapes may therefore limit the negative impacts of this economically important industry. Protecting riparian vegetation may be one such opportunity; forest buffer strips are commonly protected for hydrological reasons, but can also conserve functionally important taxa and the processes they support. 2. We surveyed leaf litter ant communities within oil palm-dominated landscapes in Sabah, Malaysia, using protein baits. As the scavenging activity of ants influences important ecological characteristics such as nutrient cycling and soil structure, we quantified species-specific rates of bait removal to examine how this process may change across land uses and establish which changes in community structure underlie observed shifts in activity. 3. Riparian reserves had similar ant species richness, community composition and scavenging rates to nearby continuous logged forest. Reserve width and vegetation structure did not affect ant species richness significantly. However, the number of foraging individuals decreased with increasing reserve width, and scavenging rate increased with vegetation complexity. 4. Oil palm ant communities were characterized by significantly lower species richness than logged forest and riparian reserves and also by altered community composition and reduced scavenging rates. 5. Reduced scavenging activity in oil palm was not explained by a reduction in ant species richness, nor by replacement of forest ant species by those with lower per species scavenging rates. There was also no significant effect of land use on the scavenging activity of the forest species that persisted in oil palm. Rather, changes in scavenging activity were best explained by a reduction in the mean rate of bait removal per individual ant across all species in the community. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that riparian reserves are comparable to areas of logged forest in terms of ant community composition and ant-mediated scavenging. Hence, in addition to protecting large continuous areas of primary and logged forest, maintaining riparian reserves is a successful strategy for conserving leaf litter ants and their scavenging activities in tropical agricultural landscapes.","Claudia L.

It is the first time this species has ever been found, and the first species within its genus, Phaenandrogomphus, to be recorded within the island of Borneo. It has been named formally as Phaenandrogomphus safei after the SAFE Project - the research project and site where it was found - and given the common name 'the SAFE clawtail' because of the distinctive claw-like appendages at the end of its abdomen.

A single male was found at one of the SAFE Project streams during standardised dragonfly transect samplings conducted by second author, Sarah Luke, as part of her PhD work studying freshwater macroinvertebrates. The dragonfly is a small member of the family Gomphidae, has a mainly black thorax and abdomen, with pale green stripes.



The discovery of this dragonfly also sheds light on the taxonomy of another gomphid species, Onychogomphus treadawayi. The most morphologically similar species to the new Phaenandrogomphus safei is not in fact any mainland Phaenandrogomphus species, but actually O.treadawayi which is known from a single male specimen found in the Philippines. It has therefore been decided that O.treadawayi should be reclassified within the genus Phaenandrogomphus.

This is the first new species described from the SAFE Project - a large, long-term study monitoring the impacts of forest disturbance and fragmentation on ecosystems - but it is hoped that as work continues at the site more of Borneo's unknown fauna will be discovered. First author, Rory Dow said:  “Discoveries such as this demonstrate how much there is still to much learn about the dragonfly fauna of Borneo. Very large areas of Borneo have never been systematically surveyed, or in many cases surveyed at all, for dragonflies; it is very likely that there are numerous discoveries still to be made.”

However, Dow also commented that “habitat is being changed by human activities at a rapid rate across Borneo, so that time may be running out for many of these fascinating insects, whilst at the same time there is an almost total lack of funding for the kind of survey work needed to find them, and the taxonomic work needed to identify and describe them.”","",43,128

Species that persist in human dominated landscapes are therefore likely to modify the way they interact. Although human impacts on community composition are relatively well studied, changes in species interactions are less well documented. Here we assess how logging of rainforest and conversion to oil palm plantations affects the populations of the ant-specialist giant river toad (Phrynoidis juxtaspera), and the availability and composition of its ant prey. We measured canopy cover as an estimate for the degree of disturbance and found that toad abundance decreased with increasing disturbance, and that retaining riparian vegetation should therefore help conserve this species. Both abundance and species richness of local ground-foraging ants increased with disturbance, and ant community composition was altered. Despite these changes, composition of ants consumed by toads was only weakly affected by habitat change, with the exception of the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), which was positively selected in oil palm plantations. This suggests that predator-prey interactions can be mostly maintained with habitat disturbance despite shifts in the community composition of potential prey, and even that some predators are capable of exploiting new prey sources in novel ecosystems.","Oliver Konopik, Claudia L.

Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity.

Ants can be good bio-indicators due to their abundance, diversity and sensitivity to environmental changes. Logging activities can alter the structure of ant communities where forest specialists are more abundant in undisturbed habitat compared to disturbed habitat. A study of ant species composition in different habitats was conducted in the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystem (SAFE) experimental sites and its surrounding areas in Sabah. This study investigates (i) difference in species richness and abundance of ant in different habitats, (ii) the effects of environmental variables on ant assemblage, (iii) species similarity and indicator species of each habitat and (iv) ant spatial distribution and species co-occurrence in local spatial scale. Ants were collected along 200m line transects according to the Ants of Leaf Litter (ALL) Protocol from old growth forest (OG), logged forest (LF) and oil palm (OP) plantation areas. Environmental variables namely forest quality, soil pH and temperature, low vegetation, canopy cover, humidity, abundance of liana, and leaf litter depth were collected. A total of 174 species belonging to 64 genera in twelve subfamilies were recorded in this study. Species richness was significantly higher in OG (121) than in LF (105) and OP (70) (ANOVA, df=2, F=89.869, p<0.001). Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that air temperature, canopy cover, abundance of low vegetation, abundance of liana, soil pH, forest quality and litter depth influenced the ants' assemblage. Many species of ants such as Strumigenys sp.1, Ponera sp.3 and Hypoponera sp.1 were associated with environmental parameters characterising the OG (high canopy cover, leaf litter depth, soil pH, abundance of liana and forest quality). Lophomyrmex bedoti and Crematogaster sp.2 on the other hand were observed associate with low forest quality, low vegetation cover and high air temperature of OP. There are five potential species selected as biological indicator for each habitat except LF. Lophomyrmex bedoti was an indicator species for OP while Strumigenys sp.1, Acropyga sp.1, Carebara sp.1 and Ponera sp.2 were indicator species for OG. Null model analysis of species co-occurrence showed the observed C-score index has insignificant difference with simulated C-score index for all habitats. The ants' spatial distribution in this study is not structured by the non-random pattern of species co-occurrence. Here we can conclude that the diversity and species composition of ground-dwelling ants were different across habitat types. The differences in vegetation structure of each habitat resulting in changes to environmental conditions which directly influence ant species assemblage. Preserving the old growth forest and logged forest are indeed important since both habitats still can harbour high number of ant species. In contrast, oil palm plantation is not capable of serving as refuge for ground-dwelling forest ants.","Muhammad Afif Bin Zakaria 2014 Thesis submitted in partial fulfillment for the Degree of Master of Science.

The conservation value of these degraded logged forests before conversion to oil palm in Sabah, Borneo, for threatened biodiversity has been poorly studied and wildlife hunting is a difficult topic to research due to its sensitivities, therefore there is a lack of data. This project evaluated the impacts of logging on mammals. (i) indirect impacts - interview based questionnaires used to gather baseline data from local people about wildlife knowledge, perceptions about wildlife and local activities affecting biodiversity, and wildlife hunting by local people. (ii) direct impacts - differences in community composition, species richness and species occupancy along a logging gradient to develop 'zones of disturbance', using randomised camera trap data of species and wildlife hunting activity, logging bulldozer data and logging extraction data. Local people's knowledge about local wildlife was low, with 36% of respondents (n = 112) correctly identifying local species. Only seven respondents admitted to hunting recently and 20 respondents had hunted. Logging was the main activity that was stated to be affecting biodiversity, followed by farming and wildlife hunting. The zones of disturbance logging activities and wildlife hunting were shown to impact species presence, with some species only occurring in green zones (currently unlogged forest), such as stink badger (Mydaus javanensis) and some species only occurring in red zones (high logging activity), including species of conservation concern, such as Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica). The occupancy analysis and zones of disturbance show that the majority of species may be tolerant of logging and wildlife hunting disturbances, such as Sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Species tolerance to disturbance during logging needs further investigation to provide valuable information for logging concession management plans and species action plans to reduce disturbance and highlight if these degraded forests have conservation value.","Amy Fitzmaurice September 2014 A thesis submitted for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science/Research at Imperial College London.

The current study aims to characterise the diets of three locally abundant cyprinid species in order to identify the key resources they exploit and how timber extraction modifies resource use. Field work was carried out over three streams which had been subjected to varying logging intensity. PCR was conducted on stomach samples taken, employing two chloroplastic, rbcL and trnL markers and one mitochondrial marker, COI. 63, 19 and 2 taxa were detected, respectively. Taxonomic richness was found to be lower in heavily-logged sites, and species were found to respond differentially to logging intensity. The results of this study serve to emphasise the importance of riparian buffer zones in mitigating the detrimental effects of timber extraction on freshwater communities. The use of molecular techniques afforded a level of taxonomic resolution that would not have been possible through classical methods, however further research should be done in order to fully explore the dietary diversity these species exhibit.","Phipps C.

Previous studies have demonstrated declines in alpha-diversity associated with this land-use modification, but trends in other components of diversity have been largely neglected. I applied Jost's “true” diversity measures with a functionally-diverse group (beetles, order: Coleoptera) to estimate ecosystem-level changes in gamma-, alpha- and beta-diversity associated with disturbance. Calculating diversity based on taxa richness, gamma- and beta-diversity decreased with disturbance. When proportions of taxa counts were considered, only beta-diversity decreased. In all cases beta-diversity is influenced by interactions between distance and disturbance, and provides a more descriptive insight into changing community structure than either other component. Generalised dissimilarity models revealed that where beta is based on richness, distance is by far its strongest predictor, whereas disturbance is stronger when proportions are included. Declines in beta-diversity likely result from reduced habitat heterogeneity and a switch from niche differentiation to habitat filtering. Studies in this field cannot continue to rely solely on alpha-diversity when beta can be the only component to respond to disturbance. Taxa proportions must be included in future diversity quantification to reveal the full impact of habitat quality on community composition. There is potential for beta-diversity to be used in determining suitable spatial scales for the efficient conservation of biodiversity in new protected areas.","Sharp, A. C. 2014.

The rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung removal activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were significantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal rates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but significant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and between reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting that these features may increase the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle community characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial variation in biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are affected by methodological choices.","Gray, C.

However, we still do not have a clear picture of the spatial patterns of felid abundance in Southeast Asia, particularly with respect to the large areas of highly-disturbed habitat. An important obstacle to increasing the usefulness of camera trap data is the widespread practice of setting cameras at non-random locations. Non-random deployment interacts with non-random space-use by animals, causing biases in our inferences about relative abundance from detection frequencies alone. This may be a particular problem if surveys do not adequately sample the full range of habitat features present in a study region. Using camera-trapping records and incidental sightings from the Kalabakan Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, we aimed to assess the relative abundance of felid species in highly-disturbed forest, as well as investigate felid space-use and the potential for biases resulting from non-random sampling. Although the area has been intensively logged over three decades, it was found to still retain the full complement of Bornean felids, including the bay cat Pardofelis badia, a poorly known Bornean endemic. Camera-trapping using strictly random locations detected four of the five Bornean felid species and revealed inter- and intra-specific differences in space-use. We compare our results with an extensive dataset of .1,200 felid records from previous camera-trapping studies and show that the relative abundance of the bay cat, in particular, may have previously been underestimated due to the use of non-random survey locations. Further surveys for this species using random locations will be crucial in determining its conservation status.

To better understand how logging affects biodiversity, we examined changes in bat assemblages across a disturbance gradient ranging from old growth to forest logged several times. In one of the first evaluations of repeatedly logged forest, we use both comparative and gradient analyses to reveal substantial signals in assemblage change in response to habitat alteration. Despite multiple rounds of extraction in the most degraded forest, neither approach revealed a definitive effect of logging on site-based richness. However, each approach generated insight into assemblage compositional responses to forest degradation. Structural differences were evident between old-growth and repeatedly logged forest, and depauperate assemblages characterised degraded sites with low, open canopy. Ordinations identified species that best contributed to the signal of assemblage change, and also key associated forest-structure variables. Models of trap-based abundance confirmed not only the importance of forest height in determining assemblage change but also the role of tree-cavity availability in supporting forest specialists, indicating that efforts to supplement this resource could aid restoration.

Estimates of b-diversity are dependent upon the spatial scale investigated, and patterns may vary across spatial scales. This presents us with a logistical problem of how to sample sufficiently at fine, local scales through to broad, landscape scales to provide accurate estimates of b-diversity at all spatial scales. 2. Here, we present a scalable sampling design based on fractal geometry that is designed to explicitly address questions about b-diversity. Using simulated communities, we assessed the efficacy of the fractal design, along with two further designs representing subsamples of the fractal design and several classical ecological sampling designs (grids and transects) to estimate b-diversity across multiple spatial scales using two measures of b-diversity: community dissimilarity modelled against geographic distance and additive partitioning. 3. All designs successfully modelled dissimilarity against distance, with the exception of grid sets and transects that were found to be unsuitable. When diversity was partitioned intomultiple spatial scales, all sampling designs overestimated large-scale b-diversity. 4. The accuracy of distance-decay estimates were primarily determined by the spatial configuration of sampling points. By contrast, the accuracy of diversity partitioning estimates was also influenced by sampling effort, with insufficient sampling effort and unsuitable sampling point configuration causing overestimates of b-diversity at larger spatial scales. We recommend that studies investigating b-diversity use a cluster-based configuration of sampling points, such as the fractal-based design presented here, to ensure accurate and comparable estimates at multiple spatial scales. Furthermore, when comparing results between studies, care should be taken to account for differences in sampling grain, sampling effort and the configuration of sampling points.","Marsh, C. J. and R.

The expansion of oil palm plantation sites in South-east Asia is the main cause for deforestation which could result in a higher prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever. This study focuses on how different land use areas (old growth, secondary forest, oil palm and housing) affect mosquito diversity, abundance and community composition. Modified ovitraps with oviposition substrates were placed in each land use area to collect mosquito eggs and larvae. Water temperatures, amount of shade and leaf number were recorded for each site. Results showed that there was a higher diversity and abundance in the old growth and secondary forest areas, but this decreased in oil palm and housing areas. A high abundance of Aedes eggs were associated with increased shade and leaf litter. The dengue vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were found within the housing areas, but not in other land use areas. Very few Aedes eggs hatched successfully in the housing area. This study highlighted that the diversity of mosquito decreased from old growth to housing areas, but the most medically important mosquitoes were only found after urbanisation.","Brant, H. 2011.

Secondary forests are an increasingly common occurrence throughout the tropics. In Malaysia, unsustainable logging practices are resulting in the conversion of vast expanses of secondary forest to more profitable land-use such as oil palm agriculture. With more than half of Borneo's remaining forest cover in active timber concessions it is important to quantify what value these forests have with regard to biodiversity conservation before they are lost. To inform this goal this study sampled insectivorous bats, which forage in the forest understory, at ten forest sites across a disturbance gradient in Sabah, Borneo. Bat abundance was significantly lower in the most-disturbed sites than in the least-disturbed sites. Species richness did not change in association with the level of disturbance. Changes in the composition of the bat community were driven by three, tree-cavity and foliage-roosting, species: Kerivoula papillosa; K. hardwickii and; Murina suilla. K. papillosa is shown to be particularly vulnerable to logging-disturbance, whereas K. hardwickii and M. suilla benefit from it. This study found compelling evidence for retaining secondary forests as important tools in biodiversity conservation. It requests that the IUCN Red List status of K. papillosa be re-assessed. Finally it offers some broad recommendations with regards to future conservation of tropical rainforests and improving reduced-impact logging practices.","Turner, A. 2011.

As such, this study investigated the impact of land use disturbance on earthworms by comparing their abundance per m2 across forest modification gradient and measured changes in environmental variables across the gradient and their subsequent effect on earthworms. Old growth (OG2), secondary logged forest (B and F) and oil palm (OP2 and OP3) sites were surveyed in SAFE Project site in Sabah, Borneo. Transect and monolith digging methods were employed to sample earthworms from soil. At each monolith, environmental variables were measured to characterise each land use by canopy exposure, litter depth and forest quality and soil samples were taken to analyse soil properties. Earthworm abundance was highest in OG2 and decreased across the disturbance gradient and was significantly lower in OP2 indicating some level of tolerance between old growth and secondary forest system. However, functional group response and changes in functional group composition varied significantly between land uses and corresponded significantly to variation in environmental variables which also significantly differed between land uses. Changes in functional group response potentially show greater implication for soil function and the ecosystem services derived from the processes. Therefore, further investigation on impact of functional group composition changes on soil function due to different land use is needed.","Rao, S. V. 2013.

Due to the paucity of data on the ichthyofauna of Sabah, understanding how this affects the diversity and abundance of freshwater fish, is of great interest as levels of deforestation and conversion to oil palm increase. This project used capture-mark-recapture to determine the abundance and dispersal of three focal taxa (N. everetti, Tor dourensis, Rasbora). Relative abundance was used to compare community similarity and absolute species turnover rates, across the land use gradient. 200m stream transects were established in old growth forest, logged forest and oil palm catchments as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. Abundance of three focal taxa decreased as riparian vegetation and stream quality decreased; despite this the highest abundance estimate was in oil palm. Community analysis demonstrated a slight, albeit non-significant difference between sampling years (p=0.054) and land use (p=0.098) between sites, and relative abundance of species varied by year and land use. Results need to be treated cautiously due to low recaptures rates and a degree of over-dispersion in the data. The difference indicated over a land use gradient is corroborated, but alternate hypotheses are somewhat divided in the literature, as suggestions of differences at the mesohabitat scale and possible barriers to migration need to be further investigated. It is recommended that intensive research is conducted to obtain a full species list, for the area in order to fully assess how logging and conversion affects fish diversity and abundance in the short and long term. A critical assessment of trapping methodologies was undertaken and recommendations as to the use of trapping techniques are made accordingly.","Wilkinson, C. 2013.

This has major effects on tropical biodiversity. In this study, changes in functional diversity are explored along a tropical forest habitat disturbance gradient in Sabah, Malaysia, for a major group of soil invertebrates, the termites. Studies of functional diversity have various advantages over traditional measures of diversity. Rather than just assessing how species assemblages change in response to habitat disturbance, functional diversity studies provide an understanding of the effects on ecosystem functioning. Six functional traits primarily relating to diet were used to calculate three functional diversity indices (FRic, FEve and FDiv). Changes in each functional diversity index, along with changes in species richness and abundance were analysed across three habitat types (old growth, secondary forest and oil palm plantation), and their relationships with forest quality and environmental conditions also investigated. Old growth forest was found to have a higher FRic, species richness and termite abundance than secondary forest and oil palm. Species richness and abundance also had a positive relationship with forest quality. Species richness was shown to have a unimodal relationship with air temperature. No significant changes were found for the other two indices (FEve and FDiv). This contrasted with a similar study in ants, which found that FEve and FDiv change with habitat type but FRic and species richness do not. This is likely to be due to different environmental tolerances between the two groups. The results suggest that termite functional diversity is at least partially reduced by habitat disturbance. Thus it is important to carefully manage habitat conversion and logging, in order to conserve termite functional diversity and preserve their important contribution to ecosystem functioning. Future studies on termite functional diversity need to sample many more species, as this will allow for a greater resolution in the statistical analysis.","March, JJ. 2013.

However, little is known about the reasons for these population declines, and how habitat features may be affecting bat distribution in this region. Species which roost in tree cavities are of particular concern, as logging reduces the number of trees available and may also affect cavity formation in the remaining trees. In order to understand whether or not tree cavities are limiting bat distribution in Sabah, Borneo, tree density and cavity availability were measured across a logging intensity gradient and analysed with bat abundance data. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling was used to ordinate species assemblage and habitat variables across the sites. Tree density and cavity availability were found to decrease as logging intensity increased. Three forest-interior bat species with declining populations were the focal point for the study, and it was found that for one species, Kerivoula papillosa, declines in this species were correlated with a loss of roost availability in disturbed habitat. Two other species' distribution, Rhinolophus sedulus and Hipposideros ridleyi, did not appear to be affected by changes in roost availability. Further research is needed to determine what other factors, such as prey availability, are causing declines for these two IUCN listed species. More research is also needed to determine what tree species forest-interior bats select for roosting, and whether or not artificial bat roosts could provide supplementary shelters to help boost populations.","Giles, EA. 2012.

This study surveyed for terrestrial leeches in primary forest, logged forest and Oil Palm plantation, and alongside waterways to identify patterns of leech encounter rate, the proportion of the species, and the biomass. As forest is logged, the total leech encounter rate increases due to the increase in abundance of H. picta; H. zeylanica declines as forest is logged. These trends are also correlated with other environmental variables. Though encounter rate increases with logging, leech biomass, measured as length, remains the same through different levels of logged forest. No leeches are found in Oil Palm plantations.

The problem is particularly acute in South East Asia and, with the rapid expansion of the oil palm industry Malaysia is one of the top global exporters of palm oil. Since this trend of habitat modification looks unlikely to decelerate in the near future, rapid assessment of existing diversity and its biological consequences is essential. Decomposition is an important ecosystem function for the redistribution of nutrients in forest soils and is performed in a large part by forest biota. This study investigates the role of leaf litter invertebrates and fungi in early stage decomposition across a range of habitat degradation; old growth, secondary forest and mature oil palm plantation. A litterbag exclusion experiment was carried out to determine the relative impacts and interaction of macro-invertebrates and fungi in the first 40 days of decomposition. The experiment excluded (a) macro-invertebrates (>1mm), (b) fungi, and (c) both macro-invertebrates and fungi. In oil palm, excluding fungi inhibited leaf litter decomposition when macro-invertebrates were allowed access but not when they were excluded, suggesting that macro-invertebrates can inhibit decomposition processes in the absence of fungi in this habitat. In old growth, only the combination of excluding macro-invertebrates and fungi caused a decrease in decomposition rate, suggesting that interactions between them are key to normal function in the system. There appears to be a degree of functional redundancy found in every habitat but the mechanisms differ between them. This result illustrates how removing certain guilds can disrupt the complex interactions of decomposer communities. More work is necessary to identify guild and species interactions in order to predict the effect of non-random species loss on the functioning of forest and agricultural ecosystems after habitat modification.","Plowman, NS. 2012.

I developed a framework for layering a neutral model with a stochastic Levins model of a keystone species, in which local community size is dependent on the occupancy status of patches in the Levins model. At each time step, if a new patch becomes occupied it is assigned to a local community which then increases in size. The layered models predict higher species richness but lower temporal stability for all communities, when compared to a neutral model alone. High colonisation rates and low extinction rates in the layered models produced higher temporal stability and species richness. In addition, increasing migration rates, local community sizes and total number of communities resulted in communities with greater levels of stability and species richness. I compare patterns of model outputs and discuss the implications of using a measure of stability for a neutral approach to community ecology. Potential parameterisation methods are suggested for using a bird's nest tree fern (Asplenium spp.) - invertebrate system, in which rainforest canopy diversity estimates can almost double when bird's nest ferns are present. This project presents a novel way of modelling keystone species in cases where they support high diversity through habitat creation.","Hamley, JI. 2012.

A functional trait based approach to studying ecological communities provides a number of advantages over a purely taxonomic method. Functional diversity can be calculated and the processes of community assembly can be investigated. Both these aspects of communities will have an influence on ecosystem functions. 2. Here, patterns of functional diversity and community assembly processes are explored across a tropical forest disturbance gradient in Sabah, Malaysia for a dominant group of terrestrial insects, the ants, in order to characterise and understand the changes that may be occurring due to conversion of forest to agriculture. 3. Three functional diversity metrics (FRic, FEve and FDiv) were calculated based on five functional traits that were chosen to represent resource use for replicate leaf-litter and soil ant communities. Differences in these metrics across habitat types were analysed and community assembly processes revealed by comparison to null distributions. 4. It is found that FEve and FDiv change with habitat type but FRic and alpha species richness do not. Furthermore, a gradient of assembly processes is found across different levels of disturbance: old growth forest appears largely competitively structured whilst oil palm habitats are dominated by a mixture of stochastic and habitat filtering processes. 5. In addition, these changes across habitat type are tied to particular functional trait complexes. Notably, traits states that are linked to hypogaeic predators appear to be underrepresented in oil palm whilst those associated with both large and small omnivores may be missing from secondary forest. 6. The pattern of these results contradicts that already reported for tropical ants. Previous work suggests a linear increase in deterministic processes with disturbance. This study proposes a quadratic relationship: pristine and highly disturbed habitats tend toward determinism whilst habitats of intermediate disturbance appear largely stochastically assembled. This disagreement is likely due to the differences in the ant fauna sampled and the analytical methods used. These results suggest that functional traits are crucial to a complete understanding of changes in community level processes in complex systems such as the rainforest floor.","Bishop, TR. 2012.

This study used capture-mark-recapture methods to investigate the response of small non-volant mammals to tropical forest logging and conversion to oil palm at a site in Northern Borneo. Trapping grids were established in unlogged primary forest, twice logged forest and oil palm plantations as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project, a large ecological experiment investigating the effects of disturbance on tropical forest biodiversity. Measures of community structure, composition and species richness were compared between the three habitats. Species-specific densities were estimated and contrasted between the different grids using innovative spatially explicit mark-recapture techniques. Finally, habitat use at the trap-level was further investigated for the three most common species as well as for the genus Rattus by modelling detection as a function of 10 micro-habitat characteristics. A total of 23 different species were caught overall. Grids sampled in logged forest showed higher species richness and similar structure to that of the unlogged forest site. Communities in both these habitats were considerably more diverse and harboured a higher number of specialised species than in the oil palm site, which was largely populated by invasive Rattus species. For two of the three species considered (Maxomys surifer and Maxomys whiteheadi), densities were found to be markedly higher in logged forest, a response partly explained by increased ground vegetation density and a pronounced heterogeneity in micro-habitat patches. Although the design limitations of this study preclude firm conclusions, it appears that logged forests play an important role in maintaining the integrity of small mammal communities and ensuring the persistence of individual species. Recommendations concerning the use of capture-mark-recapture methods to study small mammals in tropical forests are made accordingly.","Cusack, J. 2011.

Ants and termites are dominant groups in tropical ecosystems and play important roles in food webs and provision of ecosystem services such as decomposition. This study considers the effects of habitat change on ant and termite diversity, abundance and assemblage structure - the effects of environmental variables and interactions between ants and termites. Old growth forest, secondary forest and oil palm sites were surveyed in Sabah, Malaysia and ants and termites were collected from soil and dead wood. Environmental conditions and vegetation were assessed at each site, along with features of soil pits and dead wood. Generic richness and abundance of termites were highest in old growth forest, and decreased significantly in secondary and oil palm sites. Ants appeared less dependent on old growth forest, showing highest genus richness and abundance in secondary forest habitat and high occurrence in oil palm. Both ant and termite community assemblages changed along a disturbance gradient, with differences in abundance according to functional groups between habitats. High turnover in assemblage between habitat types suggests that forest specialists were not found in secondary forest and oil palm. Additional to the effects of environmental variables on ant and termite assemblages, results indicate that ant-termite interactions play a significant role in structuring communities. Occurrence of certain ant functional groups partly explained patterns of termite assemblage structure, and vice versa. Variations across habitats and scales suggest that in addition to threats caused by change in environmental variables, assemblages could be affected by changing interactions when habitat is converted. Protection of old growth forest is therefore essential for termite assemblages and forest-specialist ants, but secondary forests also provide valuable habitat and should be protected.","Luke, S. 2010.

Understanding how land use change affects the very processes underpinning ecosystem function is understudied, yet plays a key role in biodiversity conservation. This study used exclosure experiments to quantify the roles played by vertebrates and invertebrates in secondary seed removal, at a site in Northern Borneo. Transects were laid out in unlogged primary forest, twice logged secondary forest and oil palm plantation, all as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project, a large ecological project examining the effects of fragmentation and conversion to monocultural agriculture on forests in Malaysia. The relationship between rates of seed removal and forest quality were investigated. Invertebrates were found to dominate seed removal across all habitats and forest quality levels, with significantly increased vertebrate seed removal in highly degraded forest, which is thought to be linked to higher ground vegetation in these microhabitats. Although seed size and chemistry must play an important role, it appears that invertebrates play a key role in secondary seed predation and dispersal beyond what was assumed for South-East Asian forests.","Gleave, RA. 2013.
