Please see the abstract below. The conference will be 29 June to 2nd July.  See <a href=""/safe_web/static/images/news_legacy/Registration-pre-announcement_final.pdf"">here</a> for further details and also check the website at <a href=""http://www.conservationasia2016.org"">http://www.conservationasia2016.org</a></p><p>They’re looking for a mix of standard and short (3-5min) talks on oil palm sustainability issues. They’d really like to showcase our work in Sabah, and see as many SAFE researchers presenting in our symposium as possible, and of course more widely at the meeting.</p><p>Please can you let <a href=""mailto:m.j.struebig@kent.ac.uk"">Matt</a> and <a href=""mailto:eleanor.slade@zoo.ox.ac.uk"">Eleanor</a> know within a week whether you are likely to attend and whether your topic would fit within the subject, copied below. <strong>The early bird registration expires on 31st March and abstract submission is 20 March, which doesn’t leave us long, so please do get in touch soon.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Managing agro-industrial tree plantations to enhance sustainability: linking science to practice</strong><br/>
Concern over expanding agro-industrial tree plantations, such as oil palm and paper-pulp, has led to certification schemes tasked with improving environmental sustainability. The most advanced standards for safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services and social outcomes lie in oil palm certification, but new schemes are being developed elsewhere, especially rubber. Although management practices vary, the three plantation systems have remarkably similar impacts, and share key challenges in achieving environmental sustainability. There is much to be learned from oil palm in the development of new and improved sustainability labels in paper-pulp and rubber.</p><p>The symposium will provide a forum to collate the science learned in oil palm sustainability, and highlight ways to apply this knowledge to rapidly emerging certification schemes of other commodity systems.  We will identify cross-cutting research themes between the three target sectors and help build a consensus on conservation management recommendations for environmental certification. We are especially interested in the applied conservation science behind habitat management and design of plantations, the verification of existing/proposed prioritization toolkits and certification criteria, environmental/socio-economic trade-offs, and the application of emerging mitigation mechanisms such as biodiversity offsetting. Learning from developments in other sustainability meetings, we seek insights from different tree plantation systems in different country contexts, to enhance knowledge exchange between researchers, non-governmental organisations and industry. We will balance short and standard presentations, providing a forum for established and early-career researchers to present their work, and exchange ideas with those they seek to influence.</p>"

Some species of the ant-associated beetles were identified as being entirely dependent on their ant hosts.</p><p>Species diversity and abundance was compared between sites that had been logged and primary forest. Logging didn’t change the number or diversity of ant genera, but there were fewer ants in logged forest than in primary forest.  There were also variation in the species compositions found in the different forest types, meaning they host different types of ant and ant-associated beetles.  Where there were fewer ants, there was lower diversity of the ant-associated beetles.</p><p>This pair of studies highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between species and the identification of functionally significant species and their potential effects on ecosystem function. They also emphasises the importance of protecting twice logged forest in addition to the more spectacular primary forest.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">

It is the first time this species has ever been found, and the first species within its genus, <em>Phaenandrogomphus</em>, to be recorded within the island of Borneo. It has been named formally as <em>Phaenandrogomphus safei</em> after the SAFE Project – the research project and site where it was found – and given the common name ‘the SAFE clawtail’ because of the distinctive claw-like appendages at the end of its abdomen.</p><p>A single male was found at one of the SAFE Project streams during standardised dragonfly transect samplings conducted by second author, Sarah Luke, as part of her PhD work studying freshwater macroinvertebrates. The dragonfly is a small member of the family Gomphidae, has a mainly black thorax and abdomen, with pale green stripes.</p><p>

Photo credits Sarah Luke and Rory Dow.</p><p> </p><p>The discovery of this dragonfly also sheds light on the taxonomy of another gomphid species, <em>Onychogomphus treadawayi</em>. The most morphologically similar species to the new <em>Phaenandrogomphus safei</em> is not in fact any mainland <em>Phaenandrogomphus </em>species, but actually <em>O.treadawayi</em> which is known from a single male specimen found in the Philippines. It has therefore been decided that<em> O.treadawayi </em>should be reclassified within the genus <em>Phaenandrogomphus.</em></p><p>This is the first new species described from the SAFE Project – a large, long-term study monitoring the impacts of forest disturbance and fragmentation on ecosystems – but it is hoped that as work continues at the site more of Borneo’s unknown fauna will be discovered. First author, Rory Dow said:  “Discoveries such as this demonstrate how much there is still to much learn about the dragonfly fauna of Borneo. Very large areas of Borneo have never been systematically surveyed, or in many cases surveyed at all, for dragonflies; it is very likely that there are numerous discoveries still to be made.”</p><p>However, Dow also commented that “habitat is being changed by human activities at a rapid rate across Borneo, so that time may be running out for many of these fascinating insects, whilst at the same time there is an almost total lack of funding for the kind of survey work needed to find them, and the taxonomic work needed to identify and describe them.”</p><p>The type specimen will be deposited at the Forest Research Centre, Sepilok – a research institution in Sabah. The paper discussing this discovery “<em>Phaenandrogomphus safei</em>, a new species from Sabah, northern Borneo (Odonata: Anisoptera: Gomphidae)” written by Rory A Dow and Sarah H Luke is published open access in the journal Zootaxa and is available here: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3905.1.10"">http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3905.1.10</a> .</p><p> </p>"

"2014-09-11","600px-Macro_Termite_Soldier-110x110.jpg","Ants and termites are the workers of tropical rain forests.  Are these insects threatened by habitat disturbance, and what happens to the jobs they do?","<p>Scientists studying ants and termites – two of the most important insect groups in tropical rain forests – have found substantial differences in these two groups in selectively logged forest and oil palm plantations compared to undisturbed old growth forest. These changes in assemblage may cause fundamental shifts in the way tropical ecosystems function.</p><p>Work carried out at the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, in which these social insects were collected from soil and dead wood, has shown that termite abundance decreased by 70% or more in disturbed habitats and many groups of soil feeding termites were not found at all. Ants were abundant in old growth forest, selectively logged forest and oil palm plantations, but disturbed habitats supported different ants, with increases in opportunist and behaviourally dominant groups. As termites were much less abundant than ants in disturbed habitats, the relative abundance of these two groups also changed substantially across the habitat types.</p><p>Ants and termites are two of the most ecologically important insect groups in tropical rain forests and play crucial roles in breaking down leaves, dead wood and soil, dispersing seeds, and as predators and prey in food webs. They also interact with each other through predation, nest sharing or through changing the surrounding habitat. Changes in their abundance are therefore likely to have wide ranging effects on ecosystems.</p><p>This is the first time that ants and termites have been studied simultaneously using the same sampling methods along a habitat disturbance gradient, allowing direct comparisons of relative occurrence of the two groups. It is also the first study of termites in oil palm plantations. The research team, based at the Universities of East Anglia, Cambridge, South Bohemia, Imperial College and the Natural History Museum, London, will continue to study the effects of logging, forest fragmentation and oil palm plantations on ant and termite assemblages.</p><p>“This study not only provides new information on the differences in the ants and termites that are present in different existing habitat types, but also provides an extremely valuable baseline dataset for monitoring populations over time as land use continues to change in the study area” says lead author, University of Cambridge PhD researcher, Sarah Luke.</p><p>“We hope to understand how communities of these functionally important insect groups are affected by logging, forest fragmentation and oil palm agriculture, and how the important jobs that they perform may change in modified habitats.”</p><p>This work is published in the open access paper “Functional structure of ant and termite assemblages in old growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation in Malaysian Borneo” in the journal Biodiversity and Conservation (available online 30<sup>th</sup> July 2014, at <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-014-0750-2"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-014-0750-2</a>, and soon to follow in press.

"2014-06-19","2008-11-29_0548-110x110.jpg","Monitoring the above ground biomass stocks of Borneo's degraded forest-oil palm landscape","<p style=""text-align: left;"" align=""center"">
  <span style=""font-size: 13px;"">Owing to rapid expansion of oil palm plantations, Sabah’s landscape is mostly dominated by a mosaic of oil palm plantations and tropical forests which have undergone varying rounds of logging.  Another consequence of such rapid land use changes has been that a significant proportion of Sabah’s forests now exists as fragmented patches and riverine margin forests. In order to facilitate the long term conservation of Sabah’s forests (indeed those of Borneo’s forests), it is important to be able to distinguish the different forest types at a landscape scale and map their AGB stocks. Assessment of forest structure parameters via remote-sensing data offers the opportunity to examine stand parameters and to detect degradation and forest dynamics, such as above-ground biomass (AGB), at the landscape scale. Medium and fine scale optical remote sensing datasets are among the most viable options for mapping forest degradation, structure and AGB stocks at a landscape scale. However, they suffer from a fundamental flaw; they are unable to predict/model AGB values beyond 150 Mg/ha. Most tropical forests, including the ones that have undergone several rounds of logging have AGB values higher than this.  This research sought to overcome this basic flaw of optical RS datasets and make them more conducive to landscape scale AGB monitoring.</span>
</p><p>The research makes use of the novel Fourier transform textural ordination (FOTO) method, which involves the combination of 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT) and ordination through principal component analysis (PCA) for characterizing the structural and textural properties of vegetation. Fourier transforms (implemented in form of FFT) aid the analysis of the repetitive structure of the canopy by breaking the intensity signal into sinusoidal waves of different spatial frequencies and has been used as an effective way to analyse specific vegetation data from a wide range of frequencies obtained from very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite data. The method was applied to the recordings of very high resolution (VHR) Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) imagery of the study area. The technique proved useful in distinguishing between the forest types and developing individual biomass estimate models for various forest types. Results show that FOTO method is able properly to resolve high AGB values of various forest types.</p><p>These findings were in agreement with the results based on the ground measurements. This was the first time 2.5m SPOT data were used for AGB mapping in a tropical ecosystem (most of the previous high resolution imagery is less than 2m). Overall, this method has proved effective in distinguishing between oil palm plantations and the surrounding tropical forest. More importantly, this technique allowed differentiation between forests that have undergone varying logging practices and isolated riparian/riverine forests from one another.</p><p> </p><p>Read the full article <a href=""/safe_web/static/images/news_legacy/singh-et-al-2014-IntJRemSens.pdf"">here</a>.</p>"

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Supervisors: Dr Emma Sayer (Lancaster Environment Centre) and Dr Eleanor Slade (Lancaster Environment Centre and University of Oxford).</p>
<p>Tropical forests support over two-thirds of the world?s terrestrial biodiversity and play a key role in the global carbon balance. However, almost half of all closed-canopy tropical forests have already been degraded. Biodiversity loss in human-modified tropical forests continues to proceed at an alarming rate but the consequences of fragmentation and degradation for forest ecosystem functioning are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Plant diversity can influence soil carbon storage by providing decomposer organisms with different quantities and quality of plant litter and other carbon sources. Consequently, although disturbance during land-use change can cause immediate, drastic reductions in soil carbon stocks, forest modification could affect soil carbon storage in the longer-term through changes in plant diversity.</p>
<p>This PhD project aims to advance current knowledge of the links between biodiversity and function in tropical forests, focusing on the impact of land-use change and oil palm agriculture in Borneo. A series of field experiments will assess the impact of changes in aboveground diversity to test: 1) Whether reduced tree diversity affects microbial activity, carbon and nutrient release during decomposition; 2) Whether changes in plant- and invertebrate diversity will interact to impact upon soil microbial diversity and activity.</p>
<h2>Funding Notes</h2>
<p>The NERC studentship will provide an annual stipend (£13,726 2013/14 [tax free]) and UK/EU tuition fees for 3 years and 6 months. A Research Training Support Grant (RTSG) is also provided.</p>
<p>Full studentships are available to UK and EU candidates who have been ordinarily resident in the UK throughout the 3-year period immediately preceding the date of an award. EU candidates who have not been ordinarily resident in the UK for the last 3 years are eligible for “tuition fees-only” awards (no maintenance grant).

  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>CONTRACT DURATION</b>
</p><p>Up to 3 years (pending 1 year probation), ideally starting April 2014.</p><p>
  <b> </b>
</p><p>
  <b>BACKGROUND</b>
</p><p>Tropical forests support over two-thirds of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity yet, globally, up to half of the area is considered degraded. Increasingly, human impacts have resulted in environments dominated by degraded forests, agricultural mosaics and other modified habitats. The long-term persistence of biodiversity is thus dependent on the manner in which the wider tropical landscape is managed. This is particularly evident in Sabah, where substantial efforts are being made to effectively conserve wildlife populations while also managing land for timber and agriculture.</p><p>Recently, several policies have been developed to mitigate environmental impacts of rainforest exploitation and agricultural expansion. National laws and the biodiversity criteria of commodity certification schemes such as the RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil), typically favour preserving fragments of forest and riparian vegetation as conservation reserves, or <i>High Conservation Value</i> areas, within production estates. Meanwhile, agreements under the United Nations REDD+ programme (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) aim to improve biodiversity conservation as a ‘co-benefit’ of protecting forest carbon stocks. However, to date, despite many efforts to characterise biodiversity in modified tropical landscapes, few studies have been able to test the effectiveness of environmental policies using fine-scale data. This is important because without this detailed information it is difficult to know whether it is possible to conserve viable populations of threatened species as well as maintain overall diversity and carbon stocks.</p><p>There is therefore an urgent need for intensive biodiversity studies in degraded landscapes so that management recommendations to timber and agricultural companies will translate to meaningful wildlife conservation on the ground.</p><p>
  <b>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</b>
</p><p><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Scientific Aim</span></b>:</p><p><b>To delineate diversity and distributions mammal species over a modified tropical landscape seeking environmental certification.</b> Spatial data will be used to determine patterns of co-occurrence across mammal species, and to test whether degraded areas that support the highest mammal diversity are also important for all species of conservation concern.</p><p><b><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Objectives</span></b>:</p><p>1.     <b>Collect primary field data using camera trapping and acoustic recorders</b> to quantify the value of 4 habitat types for terrestrial mammals and bats. Mammal richness and habitat use will be compared between continuous logged rainforest, forest fragments and young and mature oil palm plantations.</p><p>2.    <b>Test for co-occurrence patterns between species across sites</b> to determine if the areas important for species of conservation concern are also important for other mammal species at fine spatial scales.</p><p>3.    <b>Generate distribution maps for vertebrate species of conservation concern</b> over the modified landscape, combining data from (1) with other information available from the wider consortium.</p><p>
  <b>STUDY SYSTEM</b>
</p><p>The study will be take place within the landscape modification experiment at the <b>Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) project</b> (http://www.safeproject.net/) in Kalabakan, Tawau district, Sabah. Here, logged rainforest is being converted to oil palm plantation, but replicate fragments of various standardised sizes will be retained. Using this experimental design, the SAFE project aims to understand the impacts of forest degradation, fragmentation and conversion to agriculture on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Mammal scientists from Universiti Malaysia Sabah and partners in the UK have worked at the site for 3 years. Recent results include the discovery of a population of rare bay cats, despite intensive logging.</p><p>This project will run together with a large consortium funded as <b>part of the Human-Modified Tropical Forests programme of the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council</b>. The selected candidate will be responsible for implementing and managing a camera trapping and acoustic monitoring programme at 24-30 sites across the landscape. This will enable him/her to contribute to the wider aims of the SAFE project by collecting primary data from habitats that are yet to be surveyed for mammals. There will be opportunity to learn new survey and analytical techniques alongside the wider team. The outcome of this research will not only provide training and lead to publications of high academic quality, but should also have genuine conservation management application and impact in Malaysia and other tropical countries.</p><p>
  <b>METHODS</b>
</p><p><b>(a) Fieldwork</b>:   will focus on mammal species of conservation concern, reflecting the taxonomic groups targeted in biodiversity policies such as from the RSPO. Camera traps and acoustic recorders, available from the consortium project, will be used to sample medium-large mammals and  bats across replicate plots in 4 habitat types: continuous logged rainforest, forest fragments and young and mature oil palm plantation (at least 6 plots in each). The researcher will need to set and monitor cameras and recorders at these sites with a team of local assistants, and process photographs and recordings. All sampling will follow a standardised research design so that diversity and indices of activity can be reliably compared across sites.</p><p><b>(b) Analyses</b>:    diversity and community structure will be compared across sites, and species interactions and co-occurrence patterns tested using community analyses (e.g. checkerboard distributions, guild proportionality). Landscape-wide patterns will be examined in a GIS.<b> </b>Primary field data will be combined with other existing SAFE datasets to map species presence and diversity across the landscape using distribution modelling.</p><p>
  <b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
</p><p><b>The preferred candidate will have a good degree or MSc, speak/write Malay (native speaker) and English (native/secondary), and also have forest fieldwork experience, including camera trapping, in Malaysia</b>. The researcher should expect to spend substantial time in the field camp at the SAFE project setting and monitoring cameras and acoustic equipment, although there will be regular opportunities to visit Tawau and process data at the UMS office in Kota Kinabalu. They will also be working as part of a large team, have regular communications with partners in Malaysia and the UK, and will need to manage other field staff, assist other researchers and promote the project both within Malaysia and internationally. GIS skills are also useful.</p><p><b>Potential training provided:</b> on research design and setting acoustic equipment. Depending on whether a PhD or MSc is also pursued, the researcher may also receive training in analytical techniques and data processing.</p><p>

One such species, the Striped Treeshrew, was recently rediscovered in Sabah more than 20 years after it was last recorded in the region.</p><p>So named for the bold, black dorsal stripe extending from the base of their neck to the top of their tail, very little is known about the species, prompting its listing as data deficient by the IUCN Red List. Like other treeshrews, a family that closely resemble tree squirrels and possessing the largest brains relative to body size of any mammal, it is active in the day, time it spends foraging for insects. In the absence of other research, scientists must turn to museum specimens to try and decipher anything more of the habits and behaviour of the striped treeshew.</p><p>

  </a>
</p><p>The discovery was made by a team of researchers working in the Maliau Basin Conservation Area following the first comprehensive live-trapping of small mammals in the reserve. Lead scientist of the team, PhD student Oliver Wearn said “we had suspicions that the species was in the area following a few tantalising glimpses on camera traps. However, small mammals are difficult to identify from images alone, so confirmation in the hand was needed.”</p><p>Increasingly, camera-trapping and other remote methods are being employed to survey the uncommon and mysterious taxa that tread the wild corners of our planet – for example, the same team recently documented sightings of the enigmatic bay cat, a felid that is equally unfamiliar. Nevertheless, for smaller species such as the Striped Treeshrew, the traditional trapping methods still hold sway.</p><p>The individual was found in the trap and later examined by researcher Jack Thorley, who noted “following its capture, it was clear that we could rule out two superficially similar species that coexist in the region. It was an extremely exciting find and a wonderful creature to hold in the hand. It marked the culmination of much toil lugging traps around steep, muddy slopes on unsteady footing for many weeks, so it was welcome reward.”</p><p>

  </a>
</p><p>With its warm, tropical climate, Borneo lies at the epicentre of the palm oil revolution, threatening the flora and fauna for which it is fabled. The mammal trapping which uncovered the Striped Treeshrew is just one facet of a much larger scientific undertaking, the SAFE Project, tasked with investigating the ramifications of this process of forest fragmentation and land conversion on biodiversity. With this in mind, the capture of this rare and elusive species acts as a prescient reminder of the vast and still largely unexplored riches hidden in Borneo’s forests.</p>"

</div>
<p>Now the ramifications of activities such as logging, deforestation and agricultural conversion on the web of life are to be explored by an international team of scientists which has been awarded a £4.6M grant by the Natural Environment Research Council to work at the SAFE Project.</p>
<p>The University of Aberdeen is leading a four-year study of tropical forests in Southeast Asia – the results of which should interest to policymakers, resource managers, climate change researchers, the oil palm industry, the carbon trading sector, tropical scientists and the conservation sector globally.</p>
<p>Dr Yit Arn Teh, principal investigator and senior lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, said: “Tropical forests are being cut down for timber and agriculture to meet global demands for food and natural resources. This leaves behind landscapes that are completely different from the natural ones that existed before human disturbance.</p>
<p>“Forest clearing and land conversion are leading to habitat loss and species extinctions at a rate that is unprecedented in Earth’s history. This problem is especially acute in South-east Asia, where the pace of land conversion is very high relative to the global average, and where we also see some of the highest levels of biodiversity worldwide.</p>
<p>“Logging and agricultural conversion in places like Borneo are threatening rainforest biodiversity; however, we still have a poor understanding of how humans are affecting not only charismatic, well-known species like the Asian elephant, hornbills and orangutans, but a whole host of other animals, plants and microbes that the public is often less aware of.</p>
<p>“Some of these less publicly visible organisms – like plants, insects and soil microbes – are in fact critical for sustaining living ecosystems because they form the basis of the food web and support communities of higher organisms like birds, monkeys, elephants and other vertebrates. Plants, insects and soil microbes are also responsible for ecological processes like photosynthesis, decomposition and nutrient cycling which, in turn, are globally important, because they determine whether tropical landscapes release or absorb greenhouse gases with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“At the moment, we don’t have a clear picture of how tropical forest clearing and land conversion influences the diversity of plants, insects and soil microbes; nor do we fully comprehend how changes in the diversity of these three major groups may influence key ecological processes like photosynthesis, decomposition, nutrient cycling or greenhouse gas exchange.</p>
<p>“This makes it difficult for us to model and predict the environmental effects of human activity in the tropics, both today and in the future. It also makes it challenging to work-out the best means of sustainably managing tropical forests or agricultural landscapes.</p>
<p>“We’ll be investigating how land-use change in Malaysian Borneo has altered the diversity of plants, insects and soil microbes, spanning a land-use gradient that stretches from tropical old-growth forests through to logged forests, oil palm plantations and restored forests. We’ll be trying to understand how changes in the diversity of these three major groups, in turn, influences ecological processes and greenhouse gas exchange.</p>
<p>“We’ll also be working closely with our colleagues in other research groups to understand how changes to plant, insect and microbial diversity may affect higher organisms like birds or other vertebrates.</p>
<p>“Using cutting-edge airborne remote sensing and modelling techniques, we’ll try to extrapolate our smaller plot-level measurements to Borneo as a whole.</p>
<p>“Further development of these new remote sensing and modelling techniques is also exciting because it opens up the possibility of studying large parts of the tropics from the air, opening up previously remote or inaccessible areas for scientific investigation.</p>
<p>“Also the tropics are so vast – it’s often difficult to develop a comprehensive picture of what’s happening across a country, region or continent based on a limited number of ground measurements, necessitating larger-scale measurement and modelling tools.</p>
<p>“As human activity expands and intensifies around the tropics, answers to the questions we’re posing here about the relationship between land-use change, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning will become increasingly important as we seek ways and means of making our tropical land management practices more sustainable and environment-friendly.”</p>
<p>BALI – or the Biodiversity And Land-use Impacts on Tropical Ecosystem Function consortium – is the name of the research collaboration which also involves the Universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Lancaster, Liverpool, Oxford, York, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Lancaster and the Natural History Museum in London. It also brings together a host of international partner organisations from Malaysia, Japan, Brazil and the USA.</p>

The findings are particularly important because across the tropics forest that has been intensively harvested is frequently targeted for conversion to agriculture and is perceived to hold little value for timber, carbon or biodiversity.</p><p>Dr Struebig, Lecturer in Biological Conservation from DICE, explains: ‘Recent studies have emphasised similar numbers of species living in unlogged and logged sites, but what surprised us was just how resilient some species were, even in sites almost unrecognisable as rainforest.’</p><p>Only by viewing forest sites along a gradient of logging disturbance, ranging from pristine to heavily degraded, were the team able to detect a gradual decline of some key bat species.</p><p>The research confirmed the most vulnerable bats were those that tend to live in the cavities of old growth trees. By linking bat captures with vegetation measurements from nearby plots, the researchers were able to reveal how these animals declined as successive rounds of logging took their toll on forest structure, and crucially, the availability of tree cavities.</p><p>Although logging damage was clearly detrimental to some of the species studied, the findings also offer some hope for forest restoration efforts.</p><p>‘Across the tropics there is increasing investment to restore the timber and wildlife in logged rainforests.’ says Dr Struebig. ‘For biodiversity, simple measures, such as setting artificial nest boxes for bats and birds may, if guided by research, help bring some species back to the numbers found in unlogged areas’, he said.</p><p>The research, titled: ‘Quantifying the Biodiversity Value of Repeatedly Logged Rainforests: Gradient and Comparative Approaches from Borneo’ is published in Advances in Ecological Research, Volume 48, and includes the efforts of Malaysian, Indonesian and Canadian researchers in addition to scientists from the University of Kent and the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK.</p><p>This study is the first field data to be published from the <a href=""http://www.safeproject.net/"" target=""_blank"">Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems Project</a> in Sabah, Malaysia – a new landscape experiment which combines the efforts of more than<dfn> 100 researchers around the </dfn>world to investigate the impacts of logging, deforestation and forest fragmentation in the natural world.

You will barely recognise the joint on your next visit.</p>"
