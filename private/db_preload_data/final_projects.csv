"SAFE-PRJ-1","SAFE CORE DATA","","r.ewers@imperial.ac.uk","Opportunities to conduct large-scale field experiments are rare, but provide a unique opportunity to
reveal the complex processes that operate within natural ecosystems. Here, we review the design of
existing, large-scale forest fragmentation experiments. Based on this review, we develop a design for
the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project, a new forest fragmentation experiment
to be located in the lowland tropical forests of Borneo (Sabah,Malaysia). The SAFE Project represents
an advance on existing experiments in that it: (i) allows discrimination of the effects of landscape-level
forest cover from patch-level processes; (ii) is designed to facilitate the unification of a wide range
of data types on ecological patterns and processes that operate over a wide range of spatial scales;
(iii) has greater replication than existing experiments; (iv) incorporates an experimental manipulation
of riparian corridors; and (v) embeds the experimentally fragmented landscape within a wider gradient
of land-use intensity than do existing projects. The SAFE Project represents an opportunity for ecologists
across disciplines to participate in a large initiative designed to generate a broad understanding of
the ecological impacts of tropical forest modification.",NA,"2009-10-20","2011-10-20",FALSE,FALSE,"",NA,"||"
"SAFE-PRJ-10","Quantifying Predation Pressure Along a Gradient of Land Use Intensity","399px-Coptotermes_formosanus_shiraki_USGov_k8204-7-150x150.jpg","michael.boyle11@imperial.ac.uk","Predation is a key ecological process that can strongly influence population dynamics and is potentially a good indicator of ecosystem function and trophic complexity. Fragmentation, disruption and alteration of forest structure are likely to affect the dynamics of predation (Andren & Angelstam, 1988; Rodewald & Yahner, 2001) and some studies in South East Asia suggest that predation on insect larvae increases with disturbance (Posa et al., 2007). This project will attempt to quantify predation pressure along a gradient of forest modification from oil palm plantation to old growth forest, with the goal of determining how land use intensity might modulate the characteristics of predation pressure. Key Questions: 1. Is there a significant difference in patterns of predation pressure between different levels of modified habitat? 2. If so, what structural, biotic or environmental factors might be driving these differences? 3. What could differing patterns in predation pressure tell us about the functionality of the ecosystem and its trophic stability?","The experiment will use mealworms as “prey” whose “survival” over time could be used as a measure of predation pressure. Habitat will be stratified into ground and canopy levels and live mealworms will be attached to vegetation at each level at all sites along the standard 1st order scale sampling transects used in the SAFE Project (outlined by Ewers et al., 2011). Transects will be located in old growth controls, SAFE project Block E (more blocks will be sampled if time allows) and both young and established zones of oil palm plantation. Prey will be checked every X days over a period of time (subject to trials) and survivorship data recorded. Mealworms will be cultured on site and attached to vegetation using glue and thread. Methods will be trialed in the UK to try and discover the most appropriate materials to use in the final project. For example it would not be wise to use highly toxic glue that could affect the health of any potential predators, or one that would kill the mealworms before they had been attacked. As a secondary experiment model caterpillars will be placed alongside the live prey in a similar method to that outlined by Howe et al 2009. This method, while unable to give an accurate representation of predation pressure, does allow the partitioning of estimates of predation pressure into components attributable to different taxa. In tandem with the primary experiment this will add a level of detail to the project by allowing inferences to be drawn on what taxa are contributing to the observed predation. This may provide insights into the way fragmentation manipulates predation by altering species composition, as well as altering levels of overall predation pressure. Habitat variables at each locus will also be recorded in order to examine the roles of structure and habitat complexity on predation. These will include stem density, canopy cover, vegetation cover (at each sampling habitat strata), general habitat quality (using SAFE's standardised scale), slope and aspect. Weather data will also be recorded at time of prey placement and time of collection. Pre-existing datasets on mammal, invertebrate and avian biomass will be analysed (subject to availability) as potential drivers of predation pressure.","2012-05-03","2012-07-27",TRUE,TRUE,"",81,"|Zoology|Ecology|"

However the contribution of such forest remnants to the conservation of forest species is largely poorly known, particularly in the tropics. The primary objective of this study is to document the species richness, community composition and diversity of two important vertebrate groups; the small mammals and amphibians, in riparian remnants within oil palm plantation and in degraded forests. The purpose is to assess the value of retaining riparian remnants within oil palm plantation and logged forest habitats for small mammals and amphibians conservation. Specifically we aim to answer the following questions: 1. Is there a difference in species richness and community composition of small mammals and amphibian in riparian remnants within oil palm and logged forests? 2. What effects do maintaining riparian remnants in oil palm and logged forests have on small mammal and amphibian diversity? 3. Does the structure and width of riparian remnants in oil palm and logged forests affect small mammal species and amphibians diversity? 4. How does the structure of riparian reserves could be managed to improve the extent to which they retain small mammals and amphibians communities in oil palm and logged forests?","Sampling will be conducted at several sites representing four habitat treatments: (1) riparian reserves in old growth forests as control treatment (at Maliau Basin Conservation Area); (2) riparian reserves of different widths in logged forests (SAFE project area); (3) riparian remnants of different widths in oil palm (south of SAFE project area); and (4) oil palm without any riparian remnants (south of SAFE project area). In addition, sampling will be conducted in other forest remnants within oil palm habitats. Each habitat treatment will be represented by three sites serving as replicates. We shall use grid trapping of 4 x 12 grid points (23m spacing) for sampling the small mammals. We shall establish one grid at each site with 48 trap stations. Two wire-mesh cage traps (28 x 15 x 12.5 cm), baited with oil palm fruits, will be placed at each station. For sampling the amphibians, we shall establish two transects of 400 m long at each site. Trapping of small mammals and searchers for amphibians will be conducted in four sampling sessions. In each session we will visit randomly four sites representing the four habitat treatments. Each sampling session at each site will last for four months. Overall, each habitat treatment will be sampled three times over a 12 months period. The following variables will be collected for each sampling site to characterize the habitat structure: canopy cover, number of large and small logs, number of large and small trees, percentage leaf litter cover and other variables that may influence the distribution and abundance of small mammals and amphibians.","2015-03-01","2019-04-30",FALSE,FALSE,"",96,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|Policy|Riparian|"
"SAFE-PRJ-101","The effects of habitat modification on the distribution and feeding ecology of Orthoptera","CIMG3919-150x150.jpg","jane.hardwick@griffithuni.edu.au","Together Malaysia and Indonesia produce more than 80% of all palm oil in the world (4). These countries also hold more than 80% of Southeast Asia's remaining primary forests which are critically under threat (2; 3). Changes to forest landscapes can lead to changes in tropic interactions, which can have cascading effects at a population level (6). Monitoring these effects is vital for understanding how key processes are affected by forest fragmentation and conversion to oil palm. Invertebrates are essential for maintaining forest ecosystems and their interactions with plants affect important processes, such as nutrient cycling and the maintenance of community diversity and stability (5; 8; 1). In tropical ecosystems the most significant herbivores are insects, dominated by the Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera and Coleoptera (7). This research will focus on the impacts that landscape scale conversion is having on trophic interactions and feeding ecology of the insect Order Orthoptera. Previous studies investigating Orthoptera diets in wild communities are limited, due to the complexity of accurately identifying trophic interactions among herbivores and host plants. Previous work has either relied on field observations to determine host-plant interactions or tends to involve feeding experiments, where insects are caged and given a choice of food sources; both of these methods which may not lead to an accurate identification of food preference. Part of this study will use DNA gut-content analysis to determine reliable information on diet breadth. Objectives: I. To determine how the diversity and richness of Orthoptera vary among old growth forest, logged and fragmented forest and oil palm. II. To assess the degree to which Orthoptera vary in host-plant specialisation. III. To determine whether forest conversion affects the host-plant assemblages of Orthoptera. IV. To determine whether herbivory rate is related to body size in Orthoptera and if body size varies across forest types.","Following pilot studies in sub-tropical rainforest in Queensland in early 2015, samples will be collected across the SAFE sites, including control sites comprising old growth forest, logged forest (some of which is currently being fragmented) and mature palm oil plantations. Two field seasons will be carried out in mid-2015 and mid-2016. To determine the biodiversity and richness of Orthoptera at each site, I will remove and sort Orthoptera from samples that have already been obtained as part of complementary SAFE projects; by vegetation fogging by Dr Kalsum Yusah and by light trapping by Dr Sarah Maunsell. The Orthoptera from these samples will be taxonomically sorted, so that diversity can be compared across the gradient of forest modification. Environmental variables from each site that have been obtained as part of the wider SAFE project will be collated to create a data matrix and ordination plots will be generated to explore whether the level of forest modification, as well as spatial heterogeneity, is having an effect on the distributions of Orthoptera. To assess the variation in host-plant specificity across the sites, additional samples will be obtained by hand collecting Orthoptera from a light sheet which will use a strong mercury light and a black light. Samples will be frozen then washed with 70% ethanol before dissection to avoid contamination. Guts will be removed and separated into foregut, mid-gut and hind-gut then analysed using barcoding or meta-barcoding (methods will be trailed in Australia before field work is conducted in Sabah) to determine which species associate with which host-plants and whether this varies across the habitat gradient for species that are found at all sites. Further to this, live specimens will be collected using light sheets and caged onto potted host plants in-situ. Feeding rates of species of varying sizes will be measured to conclude whether herbivory rate is related to body size and to make an overall estimate of abundance and herbivory pressure on a variety of plants from Orthopteran species across the habitat gradient.

This has urged us to better understand the complex interactions between humans and water, such that we may better predict the impacts that our interventions will have on human livelihoods, as well as the environment. The noted disconnect between humans and water in hydrological fields has led to the introduction of a new field of study with the specific aim of understanding coupled human-water dynamics and co-evolution, 'socio-hydrology'. Modelling is a very important aspect of hydrological study, and so the development of socio-hydrological modelling techniques is certainly a part of this. There will be several aspects to this project, which seems appropriate due to the multi-faceted nature of the subject in hand. The overall aim of the project will be to successfully develop a socio-hydrological model that will allow for better decision-making regarding land-use and water management issues. In a site-specific sense, I will first aim to produce an accurate hydrological model of a site in the Maliau Basin, and then determine the impacts that deforestation and palm oil cultivation can have on water resources, how this could impact livelihoods, and so future decisions that people make, and how this may further impact water resources and livelihoods.","There will be several stages within the methodology of this project. A slight quirk of this methodology is present in that preliminary modelling will come before fieldwork is carried out; this is because preliminary modelling studies will help to identify necessary data. Conceptualisation of socio-hydrological systems will first be carried out, including the use of closed-loop diagrams (CLDs) to describe the systems. This conceptualisation will include parameters relating to hydrological systems, land-use, population growth and migration, economic productivity and behavioural response. The various links between these variables will be diagrammatically shown, and this will reveal the feedback loops that exist, and how these loops may interact under different circumstances. These example CLDs will then be used to form numerical system dynamics models, initially for fictional sites and situations, but then applied to simplified, real-world scenarios. Preliminary site work will then be carried out. This will involve: 1. Preliminary site visit 2. Determine pertinent socio-economic and hydrological issues within and surrounding site 3. Development of site-specific model 4. Determination of necessary data for collection. Development of the site-specific model will then be continued and Fieldwork and data collection; this fieldwork will involve: 1. Collection of rainfall data using rain gauges 2. Installation of streamflow gauges in rivers 3. Collection of socio-economic data, including: I. Asking questions regarding health, wellbeing and other social indicators II. Economic data regarding different the benefits of different land uses Calibration, alteration (if necessary) and verification of site-specific model will then be carried out, as well as the presentation of model outputs such that they are useful for decision-making purposes.","2014-10-06","2017-04-07",FALSE,FALSE,"",132,"|Water Resources|Agriculture|Policy|"

Considering the importance of South East Asia to global biodiversity and the lower biodiversity of palm oil plantation, the continued conversion of forest to oil palm plantations, represents a serious threat. Payments for ecosystem services, including REDD+, have been suggested as a potential tool for funding the conservation of standing forest in the region, however there is no consensus on opportunity costs of such action, hence considerable debate surrounds its cost effectiveness. Despite the considerable research in this area and the importance of the industry to the region, very little accurate information on the spatial variation in establishment costs for oil palm plantations exists. As a result most studies, use a single figure for logging costs, calculated at a bloc level, as representative for the whole region, this despite the spatial heterogeneity of costs being explicitly recognised in scientific literature. Recent work however, has suggested there could be significant synergies between forest conservation and palm oil production with a greater understanding of this spatial heterogeneity. Our study aims to create a high resolution spatially explicit cost model for the conversion of forest to oil palm plantations. We then aim to use this model to explore the relationships between economics, biodiversity, conservation and land use in the context of the oil palm industry.","In order to create the cost model we will collect economic data directly from the oil palm company and logging company. From the oil palm company we will collect data on the following: Land clearing: costs of machinery (bulldozers/excavators), labour costs, chemical inputs (volumes and costs). Ploughing: cost of machinery (rental costs/running costs), labour costs (number of people, man hours, wages etc). Lining, holding and planting: seeds (costs per ton etc.), labour costs. Chemical inputs: fertilizers costs, herbicides/pesticides, pheromone traps, labour costs. Pulverisation of oil palm biomass: cost of machinery, labour costs. Construction costs: materials for road building and bridge building, cost of machinery, labour costs. Oil Palm yields/harvesting costs: productivity of individual harvesting blocs, cost of machinery, labour costs. From the logging company we will collect data on the following: Land clearing: costs of machinery (bulldozers/excavators), labour costs (number of man hours, workers hired, accommodation etc), chemical inputs (volumes and costs). Manual clearing (felling and slashing): costs of machinery (chainsaws etc), labour costs. Transportation: for workers, for machinery, types of transport used, efficiency of transport (fuel consumption etc), costs of machinery, labour costs. Profits from timber: timber volume, types of timber, transport cost, market value of timber extracted We will also collect data Information on the level of effort it takes to harvest each bloc. This will be collected by GPS tracking bulldozer (and possibly the loggers themselves), and by direct observation. This information will be able to tell us not only how much time is spent at work in each bloc, but where the effort was expended within the bloc itself. And we will collect data on the features of each harvesting bloc such as slopes, riparian zones, vegetation and soil type. Lastly we will conduct some field surveys to ground truth the data provided by the companies. Once we have these data and have created our cost model, we hope to use already existing biodiversity datasets to explore the relationships outlined above. We intend to gain access to these data through collaborations with existing researcher at the SAFE project.","2015-03-16","2015-06-15",FALSE,FALSE,"",110,"|Policy|"

Habitat modification has been shown to simplify host-parasitoid food webs, leading to an uneven distribution of interactions among predators and prey (Tylianakis, Tscharntke & Lewis 2007). Network characteristics such as interaction evenness, have important implications for ecosystem stability following habitat change. Spiders are top predators in invertebrate food webs, and are therefore likely to have a top-down influence on lower trophic levels. Likewise, lower trophic levels are likely to have a bottom-up impact on spider communities. Despite this, little is known about spider diet, especially in diverse tropical ecosystems, where many species remain undescribed and where predator - prey relationships are unknown in most cases. Similarly, insect herbivores have a top-down influence on plant productivity, while plant assemblages have a bottom-up affect on herbivore communities. Herbivores may be differentially affected by habitat change due to varying degrees of host specificity, and this is likely to affect overall food web structure. Establishing links among these multiple trophic levels will indicate how stable these food webs are in the face of dramatic habitat change, such as forest conversion to oil palm. Our research questions are: 1. How do predator (spiders) and herbivore (caterpillars and leaf hoppers) communities respond to a gradient of habitat modification in terms of their diversity and assemblage composition? 2. Are there structural changes in predator-prey and herbivore host-plant food webs across a gradient of habitat modification?","We will remove spiders, caterpillars and leafhoppers from fogging samples that were obtained across the SAFE sites in 2011 by Dr Yusah. During March and April 2015, we will conduct additional fogging sampling (for above ground invertebrates) and also take Winkler samples (for leaf litter invertebrates), at a subset of sites that were originally fogged, from which to obtain fresh specimens for gut content analysis. Spiders, caterpillars and leafhoppers will be removed from all 2011 fogging samples and sorted to species or morphospecies. Identification will be confirmed by barcoding each species using a Sanger sequencer. Barcodes, matched with digital images, will be posted online so that information will be publicly available. All sorting and DNA work will be conducted at the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre in Leiden. Trophic links in invertebrate communities have traditionally been established using visual observations (for spiders) or hand collecting and rearing (for herbivores and their parasitoids), both methods of which are limited by a number of factors such as, time needed for sampling, difficulties observing multiple, inconspicuous species, and low rearing success rate. New molecular technologies are providing an opportunity to identify trophic links a large scale, potentially enabling the construction of more resolved food webs. Meta-barcoding, for example, can detect multiple prey items in the guts of spiders (Pinol et al. 2014), and success using single-species barcodes indicates that parasitoids in caterpillar larvae (Hrcek et al. 2011) and host plants within the gut of insect-herbivores (Garci­a-Robledo et al. 2013) also have the potential to be detected using meta-barcoding. Spiders, caterpillars and leafhoppers will also be removed from fogging and Winkler samples taken in 2015 and sorted to species. The most abundant species from each site will be selected for gut content analysis. DNA will be extracted from the whole, or part of each specimen, depending on its size. Individual invertebrates will be grouped by species and sampling site in order to meta-barcode gut content. This will be conducted using an Ion Torrent sequencer. Operational taxonomic units within the gut of each invertebrate will be assigned in order to construct food webs and sequences will be compared to a DNA library, such as GenBank, in order to identify prey items within the gut (minimum taxonomic level may vary depending on quality of barcodes available for comparison). The assemblage composition and diversity of spiders will be compared across the gradient of habitat modification comprising old growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation, using 2011 fogging samples and 2015 fogging and Winkler samples. In order to compare sites we will use an index of habitat quality comprised of, for example, tree basal area and/or canopy openness. Food webs will be created for each site, linking predators to prey and herbivores to host plants. Food-web metrics will be calculated and compared across sites in order to determine if food web characteristics that can be predicted by habitat quality.

This is particularly important in the tropics where there are huge pressures to develop some of the most biodiverse areas on our planet. It is therefore a major goal in evolutionary and conservation biology to identify those species most vulnerable to anthropogenic change. Sexual selection is a widespread and powerful evolutionary force. However, its role in species adaptation or resilience to habitat disturbance and environmental change remains largely unknown, with previous studies showing mixed and equivocal results. On one hand sexual selection can be beneficial to adaptation and resilience as on average only the fittest individuals will sire offspring, therefore promoting 'good genes'. However, on the other hand, it can hinder adaptation and resilience due to costs associated with the expression of costly traits or via sexual conflict. It is also likely that these cost and benefits will be altered with environmental change, but again this remains largely unexplored, especially in the field. Using the dung beetle communities found at SAFE we will explore how different aspects of sexual selection influence adaptation and resilience to habitat disturbance. Furthermore, dung beetles also offer intriguing opportunities to investigate male reproductive strategies. Major males express horns, whereas, minor males do not and selection should act differently on each of these forms. Dung beetles are also an excellent group to ask questions related to the expression of sexually selected traits, particularly horn length-body size allometry. The main questions to be asked are: 1. Does sexual dimorphism or pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection influence the persistence of species along the disturbance gradient, and are these aligned or act in different directions? 2. Does habitat disturbance influence the expression of sexually selected traits, male reproductive strategies and horn length-body size allometry?","The dung beetle community will be sampled using baited pitfall traps along the disturbance gradient, ranging from old growth forest to oil palm plantation. Abundances of each species will be determined and by using old growth forest as a baseline the response of each species to habitat disturbance will be calculated. The intensity of sexual selection will be determined for each species by three separate measures. 1) By measuring both male and female body size sexual size dimorphism can be calculated, the larger the difference, the stronger sexual selection is acting on those species. 2) Pre-copulatory sexual selection will be estimated by calculating relative horn lengths of each species; this is a well established measure and follows the logic that those species with the longest horns are subject to the strongest pre-copulatory sexual selection. 3) Post-copulatory sexual selection will be estimated by calculating relative testes size. Increased risk and intensity of sperm competition selects for larger ejaculate sizes, therefore as the number of potential males a female will mate with increases selection will favour those males with greater investment in testes size. We will then be able to answer Q1. From the above measures of body size, horn length and testes size we will also be able to explore Q2. We will be able to determine if average horn length or testes size differ with habitat disturbance. By gaining these measures in the same individual we can also see if any relationships exist between horn length and testes size, gaining insight to differing male reproductive strategies. Also by gaining measures of horn length and body size we will be able to explore the horn length-body size allometry of each species and determine if habitat disturbance changes this relationship.","2015-06-01","2015-08-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",48,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"

The forested habitat alongside rivers, known as riparian zones is primarily retained because it can generally provide a natural mitigation system for run-offs and erosion, groundwater and soluble, and sediments and contamination. A proper design of habitat patches, corridors and riparian zones could maintain the ecological process and biodiversity, but this has not been thoroughly tested in the tropics for mammals. Riparian reserves are potentially important for biological conservation because they might be used by mammals to travel, seek refuge and forage. However, the conservation value of retaining these areas within oil palm plantation and in highly degraded forest areas is still poorly known for medium- to large-sized terrestrial mammals. This study aims to examine the extent to which retaining riparian reserves could maintain mammal community in logged forests and in oil palm plantations with a view to provide useful information for how to increase the conservation value of riparian reserves in such landscapes. The specific objectives of this study are: 1) To identify species richness, diversity, composition and similarity or dissimilarity of mammals in riparian reserves within oil palm plantation and in oil palm plantation without riparian reserve, 2) To identify species richness, diversity, composition and similarity or dissimilarity of mammals in riparian reserves within continuous logged forest and in riparian reserves within primary forest, and 3) To assess the effects of the different width of riparian reserves on mammal species richness, diversity and composition in oil palm plantation and in logged forest. We aim to answer the following questions: 1) How can riparian reserves in oil palm plantation support mammal community? 2) Do the different widths of riparian reserves affect the structure of mammal community? 3) What is the effect of forest clearance to the mammal community in the riparian reserves within the continuous logged forest?","To address the objectives of this study, four habitat treatments represented by several sampling sites will be sampled as follows: 1) riparian reserves with different widths in continuous logged forest within the SAFE experimental area (represented by 6 sites); 2) riparian reserves with different width within oil palm plantations in the south of the SAFE project area (6 sites); 3) oil palm plantations without riparian reserves in the south of the SAFE project area (3 sites); 4) riparian reserves in primary forest in VJR Brantian Tantulit (1 site). Sampling of terrestrial mammal community will be conducted by camera trapping techniques at all sites using remotely-operated digital camera traps (Reconyx HC500, Holmen, Wisconsin, USA).

Grids will be established using a measuring tape and GPS receiver. Since the number of camera traps available for this study is limited, only four to five sites will be sampled at a time, and two trapping rotations will be scheduled for the camera trapping deployment at each of the two grids at a sampling site. During a sampling rotation, a total of between 7-8 cameras will be deployed at random in each grid. The total number of camera traps to be deployed in the two sampling rotations at a particular sampling site will equal 30 camera traps (15 cameras in each of two grids). Each camera trapping rotation will take between six to eight weeks and the time interval between 1st trapping rotation to the 2nd trapping rotation is also between six to eight weeks.

By extracting and analysing the mammalian blood meal from the leeches at different sites I will look at the differences in community assemblages and whether this is affected by degree of human modification. The mammalian DNA will be sequenced and identified using next generation sequencing and will allow the host to be identified to species or genus level. In the previous study pioneering this molecular method in Vietnam, rare, newly described and cryptic species were identified (Schnell et al., 2012). Borneo has high levels of endemism and many small mammals are elusive and difficult to trap using traditional methods and leech blood-meal analysis will reveal accurate levels of mammal diversity. The results will be compared with data from camera traps at the same locations collected by LOMBOK consortium and SAFE scientists, Ollie Wearn and Rob Ewers. Eventually, this will feed into the evaluation of the REDD+ policies, to see if conserving for carbon also aides biodiversity conservation. I will also be collecting dung beetles for species identification as dung beetles are also important indicators of ecosystem health and mammal communities. 1. Schnell, I. B. et al. Screening mammal biodiversity using DNA from leeches. Curr. Biol. 22, (2012).","I will be sampling land leeches of both species, Haemadispa picta and Haemadispa zeylanica, commonly known as the tiger and brown leech. To achieve this I am visiting every second order point across the SAFE landscape, excluding the oil palm control sites as there are no leeches found here. At each second order point leeches are collected using passive and active searching within the 20x20m SAFE vegetation plot. Passive searching includes collecting leeches off a sheet dragged behind the researcher and active searching includes looking for leeches in the leaf litter and understory. All leeches encountered within 20 minutes are taken back to the UK for subsequent genetic analysis. At each sampling point in the riparian strips 10 minutes is spent searching on both sides of the bank. Baited pitfall traps will be set at half of the second order points for 48 hours to collect a subsample of dung beetles, representing all fragments, controls and riparian strips. I will return to the same sites in subsequent years before and after the experimental blocks have been isolated.","2015-02-15","2018-05-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",120,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"

I will use stable isotope analysis to track Carbon and Nitrogen from the grazing (green) and detrital (brown) food chains up to bats (apex predators), routing through invertebrate prey. I will use standard Î´13C- Î´15N bi-plots to represent food webs across habitats with a gradient of perturbation, aiming to uncover patterns of change in the relative position of different trophic groups (Schmidt et al, 2007). I will also apply a suite of metrics to quantify changes in the breadth of resource use within bat populations and communities across the gradient (Layman et al, 2007; Jackson et al. 2012). This will give an indication of the changing trophic ecology of the resilient species and assemblages, which is important for predicting the future stability of communities. In addition, I will collaborate with Eleanor Slade to investigate how changes in above-ground biodiversity mediate altered biogeochemical cycling via changes in the brown (decomposer) food web, using the distinct isotope signal of C4 dung from maize-fed cattle (introduced to a C3 dominated flora) to trace the dung-derived Carbon within a suite of mesocosms. The results of these investigations will inform policy on biodiversity conservation, particularly testing the assumptions underlying the targets of policy to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+).

In order to minimize these losses in heavily cultivated landscapes, there is a need for active management. Riparian reserves are one such management intervention designed to improve the biodiversity value of agricultural land. Riparian reserves are areas of native vegetation along rivers that are maintained within the agricultural landscape. Recent studies have begun to demonstrate their biodiversity value in tropical ecosystems. For example, in Malaysia riparian reserves host similar numbers of ants (Gray et al. 2014a), dung beetles (Gray et al. 2014b) and amphibians (Norhayati, Ehwan and Okuda 2014) as nearby continuous logged forest, whilst non-vegetated rivers in oil palm had significantly lower species richness. However, the ecological roles of these riparian reserves have not been widely studied and are particularly poorly understood for mammals. Bats in Borneo are among many vertebrates for which high diversity is associated with habitats that have little disturbance, or are highly heterogeneous and structurally complex. They are known to be particularly sensitive to habitat disturbance and the changes to the configuration of landscapes (i.e. fragmentation) that are brought about by land-use change. Maintaining forest-like vegetation in riparian reserves within plantations could allow these species to persist within the otherwise adverse environment of oil palm. The importance of riparian reserves for bats has not been explicitly studied in Southeast Asia, however in other parts of the world these features are known to serve as navigational cues across landscapes and provide important foraging grounds (Galindo-Gonz¡lez, Sosa and Ammerman 2003; Monadjem and Reside 2008). These positive results, combined with the disturbances bats face in human-modified landscapes of Southeast Asia, demonstrate the importance of investigating how riparian reserves may mitigate the declines that are predicted if no action is taken. This study will therefore assess the importance of riparian reserves for the abundance and diversity of bats in a forest-agricultural landscape in Sabah, Malaysia.","Acoustic sampling will be undertaken along the eight experimental riparian zones (including two controls) currently in logged-over forest, and six established riparian reserves in the surrounding oil palm estates, and used by the NERC-LOMBOK consortium. These riparian corridors have experienced a gradient of forest disturbance and they also vary in width, ranging from 20-50m wide. There are also other rivers in the wider forest and oil palm landscape that I could sample as additional control sites (forested, non-forested riparian). The SAFE landscape has a network of logging roads (i.e. linear transects) that could also serve as control bat flyways if deemed necessary. Acoustic surveys will be conducted after sunset (i.e. during the peak period in bat foraging activity) along the riparian reserves in order to quantify the diversity and activity of bats present, and compare this information between sites (e.g. forested, oil palm). At each site I will record bats using an Echometer 3+ or Songmeter SM2+ bat detector (Wildlife Acoustics PLC) at 8-10 sampling points along the river, spaced approximately 200 metres apart (a near match to second order points and including all SAFE riparian plots). I will record for 10 minutes at each sampling point, ensuring some of this time is spent investigating the adjacent river banks either side of the river- total recording time 80-100 minutes per session. Each site will be sampled twice or three times depending on limiting factors such as weather. Habitat surveys will be conducted by extending the 25m x 25m SAFE vegetation plot design alongside a subset of my sampling points in each riparian area. In addition to the core biomass, stem density and canopy information collected by SAFE I will also delineate the width of the riparian reserve at each sampling point using SPOT or RAPIDEYE satellite imagery in GIS, and the width of the river using a rangefinder. Insectivorous bat species will be identified via the recordings of their calls using specialist acoustic software such as BatSoundPro and Kaleidoscope. This will allow species identification for many of the bats recorded (or echotypes for problematic identification), and counts of these species at the different sites. At each site I will quantify the number of species present, and the activity (number of bat passes by the microphone) of any given taxon. Foraging individuals can also be distinguished by echolocation pulses becoming more frequent during recordings (i.e. feeding buzzes). I will then compare the numbers of taxa, bat passes, and foraging activity between sites and groups (e.g. oil palm riparian reserve versus forested) using standard univariate statistics. Association of this information with vegetation and landscape data will be determined using multivariate statistics such as ordinations and regression analyses. Specifically I will test whether river segments with larger riparian buffer zones support more bat species and promote greater bat activity.","2015-05-07","2015-07-03",FALSE,FALSE,"",100,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|Riparian|"
"SAFE-PRJ-11","Structure and dynamics of mutualistic frugivory and seed dispersal networks","seeds-safe-110x110.jpg","rajeev.pillay@ufl.edu","The unraveling of complex interactions among species in the face of human land-use change is predicted to reduce ecosystem functioning and impede the maintenance of ecosystem services. A major gap in knowledge exists about the impacts of habitat fragmentation on ecosystem-shaping mutualistic interactions, such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Because of the diversity of frugivore and plant species involved, these interactions are often described as mutualistic ecological networks. Not only is land-use change predicted to alter interaction structure in mutualistic networks due to the decline and loss of key dispersers, but the conversion of the habitat itself into a spatial network of fragments of variable quality and isolation may influence the interaction network of species. Such effects of spatial patch networks on mutualistic interaction networks may arise from differing mobility of various frugivores/dispersers, which may alter functional connectivity. Nonetheless, this potential interplay of spatial habitat networks coupled with species interaction networks has been inadequately investigated. Furthermore, frugivory does not equate to successful recruitment and the process of seed dispersal involves several intermediate steps. It remains poorly tested whether frugivory networks are different from final successful recruitment networks. Our objectives are to address these major gaps by answering the following questions: 1) How do forest cover and differing mobility of various frugivores/dispersers influence frugivory and seed dispersal networks over space? 2) To what extent are individual components of frugivory and seed dispersal networks-frugivory, seed removal, seed deposition and recruitment-disrupted over a gradient of fragmentation and effective isolation? 3) Does compensatory redundancy among dispersers resilient to fragmentation buffer mutualistic networks against the loss of particular dispersal agents?","The unit of sampling for this study will be the 25m by 25m vegetation plots that are located at each second order sampling point in the experimental and control sites. Fruiting species in each vegetation plot will be identified, tagged and geo-referenced. Remotely operated digital video cameras will be strategically placed at fruiting trees in each vegetation plot. At least two individuals of each fruiting species within each sampling unit will be fitted with a pair of cameras, one arboreal, focusing on frugivory near the canopy and, the other terrestrial, focusing on frugivory near the ground. This will enable 24-hour observations of feeding interactions by frugivores/dispersers in the canopy and on the forest floor. We will follow a blocked sampling design wherein cameras will be placed at fruiting trees in four randomly selected vegetation plots in a block (A-F), one plot in each patch size category of 1, 10 and 100ha and one plot in the oil palm matrix, for the duration of a week. Thereafter, the cameras will be moved to a second group of four randomly selected vegetation plots within each patch size category for the second week and so on, until the 16 vegetation plots in that block are sampled in four weeks. All the six blocks A-F and the plots in the control sites will be similarly sampled once each within both dry and wet seasons so that seasonal variation in fruit-frugivore/disperser interactions is obtained across a gradient of fragmentation and forest cover. We will supplement cameras with focal observations of interactions between diurnal and nocturnal frugivores/dispersers and fruiting plants at a subset of camera locations. Data collected from the cameras and focal observations will include fruit handling method, rate of fruit removal, time spent foraging, seed retention time, defecation rates, distance moved and rates of movement of individual frugivores. This will enable construction of the frugivory network and the seed removal network, the latter comprising frugivores/dispersers that remove fruits away from the parent tree. Observational data on frugivore seed retention time, defecation rates and movement rates will enable the construction of dispersal kernels to model the seed deposition and recruitment networks.

On Borneo, local diversity exceeds 70 species (including 20 ground squirrels, 14 flying squirrels, 16 tree shrews, and 26 murid rodents), making these animals the second most diverse mammal group after bats. Biological inventories and conservation assessments traditionally rely on cumbersome live trapping in understorey habitats, and/or observational records of arboreal species, both of which are plagued by considerable methodological biases. At best, inventories are representative for murid rodents and some of the most easily identified arboreal species, but are particularly poor for the least conspicuous and/or nocturnal squirrels and tree shrews, many of which are rare, endemic and/or threatened taxa. This leaves 30+ species poorly unaccounted for in applied ecological research, which implies that our understanding of how tropical small mammals respond to environment change could be grossly under-, or indeed over-, estimated. Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques allow us to extract viable DNA from degraded samples such faecal matter and fur. This prospect makes fur-trapping in particular a potentially cost-effective sampling technique and one that could greatly improve our understanding of elusive tropical mammals and minimize reliance on live trapping and the ethical issues this brings. Fur sampling is proving particularly popular in Europe and North America, albeit for fewer target species. We will trial the use of various fur trapping techniques at SAFE, with the aim of rolling out large-scale replicated sampling over the landscape to help understand responses of small mammal species to land-use change, and in particular fragmentation. Our work will be embedded within the NERC-LOMBOK sampling design, particularly in fragments and riparian reserves, allowing us to compare our findings to those of other taxonomic groups at matched localities. If viable, optimizing a protocol for rapidly sampling small mammals could revolutionize the way we undertake ecological monitoring for this understudied taxonomic group in the tropics, and give us an insights into the conservation genetics of small mammal populations in relation to habitat fragmentation.","Fur traps, or sticky tubes, typically comprise PVC piping of various sizes with a sticky substrate inside that removes fur as a mammal passes through. We will trial the use of various sized pipes, in different configurations (bole, branch, high, low) and using different baits (e.g. seeds, oil palm fruits), over 276 x 92m grids already operational for cage trapping and camera surveys. Tubes will be set for a 2-4 week period and checked periodically to collect fur, renew substrate, and re-bait. Once an optimum sampling regime has been identified, and in particular compared with detection rates of cage trapping, we will roll out broader scale sampling across a network of grids used by SAFE researchers and the LOMBOK consortium. These could include >60 grids on 2nd order points in fragments and control plots first utilised by Imperial researchers (Ollie Wearn, Phil Chapman), and an additional >30 grids established in riparian zones within and outside the experimental area by the LOMBOK consortium (Matt Struebig, Esther Baking, Henry Bernard). Additional sampling may be undertaken in the wider network of established fragments in the planted Benta Wawasan estates (e.g. Menggaris, Belian, Merbau, Selandang Batu). Fur will also be sampled from an ongoing cage trapping campaign in the SAFE area to help match unknown fur samples to known species that aren't represented in genetic repositories (e.g. GENBANK), and provide a fall-back research project should fur trapping prove unviable. Along with measures of species diversity and community structure, and individual recapture histories arising from this technique, we envisage being able to quantify variation in phylogenetic diversity over the landscape, and population structure of the more common species using neutral genetic markers for example.","2016-09-01","2019-08-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",105,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|"

Increasingly, anthropogenic alterations have resulted in environments dominated by secondary forests, agricultural mosaics and other human-modified habitats, leading to profound changes in biodiversity. Logged forests are increasing considered an important habitat to protect for both ecosystem stability and biodiversity preservation. However, the value of logged forests in preserving biodiversity depends on the landscape scale context. Understanding how factors such as fragment configuration, fragment shape and size and distance to continuous forest affects communities is therefore vital for landscape planning in order to maximise biodiversity. Fragments in the broader oil palm landscape are most often on steep slopes or in protected riparian reserves. Malaysian law mandates the preservation of 30m riparian buffers along all rivers and streams of greater than 5m. Although studies from other parts of the world have examined the role of riparian strips in preserving vertebrate diversity most of these have taken place in the Neotropics.","In collaboration with the HMTF LOMBOK team I will continue with and expand upon work initially undertaken by myself and Dr David Edwards (on a previous permit), to assess the bird communities of across the SAFE landscape in both fragments and riparian zones. Concurrently I will also run acoustic monitoring assessments of bat communities along riparian corridors in order to augment bat sampling taking place in fragments through the HMTF LOMBOK. By generating occupancy models across both taxonomic groups I aim to elucidate the changes in vertebrate diversity in relation to various configuration and landscape-scale questions as well as the changes in both bird and bat communities associated with fragmentation with particular references to riparian buffers. The bird community will be assessed through visual and audio point counts undertaken at all SAFE second order points, each lasting fifteen minutes in duration. This will augment work started by DE. Each site will be visited a minimum of four times between 6am and 10.30am. Birds in riparian will be assessed similarly by visiting 10 points, spaced ~200m apart along each of the SAFE rivers. In addition the LOMBOK consortium have established six points at 6 rivers in the oil palm concession and I may further augment these with rivers in the broader oil palm landscape. Assessments of avifaunal community composition and health may be further augmented by deploying mist nets in both fragments and riparian zones. At the same 10 riparian points, acoustic monitoring of the bat community will take place in conjunction with Dr Matt Stuebig.

Artificially transplanted seedlings allow ecological questions to be examined with more control than using naturally occurring individuals. By planting seedlings at regular intervals from forest boundaries, edge effects will be investigated. We will focus on insect herbivory and how proximity to the forest edge affects the rates of leaf damage and communities of endophagous herbivores. Plant-insect herbivore relationships represent some of the most dominant interactions on Earth (Agrawal et al. 2012). Insect herbivory is generally supposed to occur at higher rates in the tropics and accordingly should have greater impacts in tropical forests. Insect herbivores are important components of biodiversity and play a vital role as consumers. The way that they interact with plants and predators has consequences for food-web structure, carbon and nutrient cycling, and individual plant fitness. These impacts have cascading effects at community levels (Coley & Barone, 1996; Ruiz-Guerra et al. 2010; Metcalfe et al. 2013; Bagchi et al. 2014). Changes in herbivore communities therefore stand to have major implications for ecosystem quality: 93% of leaf damage in tropical ecosystems is carried out by leaf chewers, with leaf mining accounting for 4%, and galling and skeletonising causing 1.3% of damage (Adams et al. 2009). As a result over 50% of studies on insect herbivory have dealt solely with leaf-chewing taxa (Novotny et al. 2010). This means a disproportionate amount of information is available for this guild of insect herbivores and a relative dearth of knowledge on others. By focussing on concealed and semi-concealed insect herbivores such as leaf miners, gallers and rollers, we will address these gaps in knowledge.","Seedlings of two endemic dipterocarp species will be sourced from the IKEA nursery and planted at the beginning of the wet season in 2015. Six seedlings of each species will be planted at each sampling point. Each will be placed at least 50cm from their nearest neighbour, in three groups of four individuals (2 of each species). Enclosures of chicken and barbed wire will be built around each group in order to protect them from damage by mammals. Planting will be carried out as follows: At four second order points in the 100ha plots in D, E and F; At four second order points in the 10ha in D, E and F; At eight second order plots in VJR, LFE and LF Sampling within the fragmented blocks (D, E and F) will allow for edge effects to be tested against control sites comprised of continuous forest (VJR, LFE and LF). Leaves of each of the experimental plants will be marked using indelible ink and scanned before planting. They will then be left to establish and scanned once more after a six month period. The software ImageJ will be used to quantify the percentage leaf area loss to insect herbivory and the proportions of damage by each insect herbivore guild. In 2016, a series of measurements will be taken every three weeks, over a three month period, in order to determine the rate of herbivory. At the end of this period seedlings will be destructively sampled and leaf material will be placed in rearing containers in order to rear any internal herbivores to adult stage for identification.

"SAFE-PRJ-114","Assessing the effect of altitude on Sabah's mammalian community","Pardofelis-marmorata-150x150.jpg","heather.hemmingmoore14@imperial.ac.uk","1. Background: A number of camera trapping efforts have been undertaken in Sambah state, Malaysian Borneo, for the purpose of assessing the mammalian community (Bernard et. al. 2013, Wearn et. al. 2013, Brodie and Giordano 2013). However, the species richness, activity patterns, and community composition are still relatively unknown for many parts of the island (Bernard et. al. 2013; Brodie and Giordano 2013). Given the rapid conversion of forest to monoculture plantations, particularly oil palm (Edwards et. al. 2014), it is essential to develop a baseline understanding of the distribution and behavioural patterns of mammalian populations (Bernard et. al. 2013) so as to better understand and measure the effect of deforestation and large monoculture crops on species richness, abundance, and distribution. 2. Conservation Issue and Objective of Study: Elevation is one of only two factors determined to be correlated with oil palm productivity, with lower elevations yielding higher outputs (Edwards et. al. 2014). Of the 21,000 hectares of oil palm plantation assessed by Edwards and her team, it all occurs below 380 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l). Edwards et. al. also found that of the forest fragments retained within oil palm plantations, steepness is one of two reasons cited for maintaining this habitat. Therefore, we know that palm oil plantations are avoided in areas with higher elevations and especially steep slopes. Few previous camera trapping studies have not focussed on elevation. Brodie and Giordano (2013) conducted a camera trapping study in primary and logged forest at elevations between 230 and 1120 m.a.s.l. Other studies, however, have focussed on lower and Wearn et. al. controlled for a mean elevation of 432 m.a.s.l. and Bernard et. al. did not set any camera traps above 650 m.a.s.l. Therefore, the potential effects of pushing Borneo's mammalian species into sloped and higher-elevation habitat are not known. If higher elevation landscapes do not provide a suitable habitat, we are potentially threatened with a decline in the island's already-threatened species, including Sunda Clouded Leopards, Orang utans, and lesser known carnivores such as Bay Cats, Marbled Cats, and Leopard Cats. 3. Hypotheses: Considering that oil palm plantations remain extremely profitable and occur at low elevation (Edwards et. al. 2014), it is reasonable to assume that deforestation will continue at a higher rate below ~400 m.a.s.l. Therefore, surveys should be conducted to assess the difference in the large mammal community between lower elevation areas (many of which have been surveyed before) and areas of higher elevation and steeper slopes. Additionally, it should be assessed whether there is a bias toward designating protected areas in areas of higher altitude, regardless of habitat suitability for the island's mammals. I expect to find that species richness will peak at mid elevations and will decline at higher elevations and landscapes occurring on steep slopes. The potential effects on specific species are unknown, and we are especially interested in the viability of Borneo's mammals at elevations above 380 m.a.s.l..","As much of Malaysian Borneo has been logged, legally or illegally, I propose to conduct surveys in primary and logged forest, from altitudes of 10 to upwards of 1000 m.a.s.l. I am particularly interested in elevations just above 380 m.a.s.l., as this altitude may represent the upper limit of palm oil plantations, and therefore it may remain available as habitat in the future as lower areas are cleared. Straight elevational transects will be conducted, with trap cameras deployed in an essentially straight line, ascending up a slope. This design would provide a straightforward survey design, which could be repeated in the future. It would provide a method by which elevation could be easily controlled for each data point. Sites will be selected as similarly as possible to the methodology used by Wearn et. al., which incorporated an aspect of random selection to capture data away from roads and trails. Three deployments of ~30 trap cameras will be conducted, lasting four weeks each, therefore sampling ~90 locations. The cameras will also be checked approximately two weeks into each deployment. The Stability of Altered Ecosystems Project is a long-term field site in Malaysian Borneo, which was set up to study the long term effects of logging, forest fragmentation, and oil palm plantations on the ecology of the forest ecosystem (http://safeproject.net). Imperial College has a long history of close collaboration with the SAFE project. All work would be conducted with local field assistants, and I would work with in-country collaborators, notably Dr. Henry Bernard from the University of Malaysia Sabah. SAFE Project Site (GPS 4.708048, 117.580972) I propose to sample the VJR around the Stability for Altered Forest Ecosystem (SAFE) Field Site for four weeks, before shifting to the Maliau Basin Field Centre to conduct a survey of the primary forest Maliau Basin for four to eight weeks. Sampling both sites would provide the elevational change required for my proposed study. Areas of forest at various stages of logging near the SAFE Project Site would provide an ideal location to conduct elevational transects. Being based at SAFE would provide the added benefit of being logistically more feasible, and synergies could be realised with existing data that has previously been gathered (Wearn et. al. 2013). Maliau Basin (GPS 4.751349, 116.954371) Maliau Basin and Imbak Canyon were identified by Bernard et. al. (2013) as two of the most important conservation areas in Southeast Asia. It is one of the few locations that houses low-altitude primary rainforest, and contains a large altitudinal range. As one of the few remaining areas of pristine forest in Malaysian Borneo, a study of the mammalian community in Maliau Basin would provide a baseline for future study, which could be undertaken at regular intervals to track the effects of climate change, land use change in other parts of the island, as well as to provide a comparison with studies conducted in logged forest ecosystems. Brodie and Giordano conducted a mammal study of Maliau Basin in 2013; we would incorporate their findings and their survey points in our survey design.","2015-04-20","2015-07-15",FALSE,FALSE,"",5,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"

The physical process of logging is likely to dramatically alter the distribution of animal species, and with it potentially their parasite load. It is important to build an understanding of the host-parasite interactions for this diverse group it is important because small mammals are known to harbour parasites that transmit zoonotic diseases to people, and it is unknown at this point what the implications of deforestation are for small mammal's parasite burden. I will be investigating the difference in the parasite burden of small mammals caught in the live traps across the sampling grids in the different habitats at SAFE, which is closely related to work previously carried out by Oliver Wearn, which has already started to reveal mammalian community responses to habitat degradation. Oliver's work is being continued by Philip Chapman, who is also examining changes in dispersal and movement behaviour of mammals in response to habitat degradation. My project will be closely linked to this line of research. Our expectation is that logging will increase the density of small mammals in remnant habitats that are not destroyed, and that surviving individuals will be stressed, potentially leading to increased parasite burden and transmission among individuals.","My project will involve working alongside PhD candidate Philip Chapman, who is currently collecting data using the small mammal live trapping grids set up by Oliver Wearn in the third-order sampling points in the SAFE fragment system. I will be placing plastic inserts into the bottom of the small mammal traps to collect any feces deposited by the animal during its time in the trap. Upon collection of the traps, I will collect any fecal samples and take them back to the lab for analysis. For analysing these samples, I will be using passive flotation technique to establish the number of parasite eggs present in each fecal sample. I can then calculate the number of eggs per gram of each mammal caught, and identify the number of different types of parasite they are infected with. I will then compare the parasite burden of individuals from the different types of habitat, including primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. I will also be able to compare parasite diversity between individuals caught in the different areas. The aim of this is to test the idea that the combination of stress of logging and a high density of individuals in a remnant habitat is likely to increase their parasite burden.","2015-04-20","2015-06-30",FALSE,FALSE,"",95,"|Zoology|Infectious Diseases|"

Here we aim to show whether net insect movements can be predicted by environmental gradients in differing forest types (logged, old-growth, oil-palm). This project will continue on from previous work where flight intercept traps have been used to capture ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and beetles (Coleoptera) twice per year for the last three years. Samples will be collected along a gradient of patchy forest structure, taking advantage of pre-existing logging damage to investigate movement patterns in response to variation in forest structure and environmental gradients, allowing us to test hypotheses about likely non-random patterns of invertebrate movement. For example, do invertebrates move from low to high light environments; from low to high fruiting and flowering environments; and from low to high biomass environments? We will also aim to identify the scale over which insects respond to different environmental factors by using different distances between variables as predictors of movement. This project is looking at whether insects move over larger environmental gradients rather than between small microhabitats. Statistical models of invertebrate movements will be scaled up using remotely sensed maps of forest structure to determine potential locations of source and sink invertebrate populations within a continuous, but non-uniform, forest landscape.","Modified malaise traps will be used at 100 locations to collect flying insects over a period of 7 days. Traps will be designed to collect insects and separate them based on the direction they enter the trap from. This will be carried out using four malaise traps set up at each location that each exclusively collect insects entering the trap from one compass point. Traps will be suspended approximately 1.5m from the ground and prevented from spinning using guy-lines. These traps already have two planes of Perspex that intersect, dividing the trap into four parts. Three of these sections will have the collecting funnel blocked so that insects may only enter the trap from one direction, the direction of interest. By pooling the contents of these traps we can also reconstruct samples irrespective of direction sampled from. Environmental variables will be recorded at the site of the malaise traps and along transects of approximately 300m in length running away from the traps in the direction of each compass point (and thus the direction that the traps have sampled insects dispersing from). Data on canopy cover, fruiting and flowering scores, leaf area indexes and above ground biomass will be collected to identify predictors of insect movements. These variables will be recorded at a series of distances along the transects to test a hypothesis of the scale over which these insect movements are best predicted. Insects will be identified to order and abundance and biomass will be measured. Although ideally one would identify specimens to a species level, in the time frame of this project, this is unfeasible and there should still be patterns that can still be observed using this less detailed method of identification. Importantly, we expect that species within the same order may have similar movement patterns, e.g. towards new leaf flush in the Orthopterans. The abundance and biomass of insects flying from one compass point towards another will be used in conjunction with environmental variables to ascertain if there are patterns to net insect movements in different forest structures and if these patterns differ between orders. For each direction, we will be able to ascertain whether net biomass is moving to or from certain environmental predictors. E.g. we may expect to see a greater number of insects flying away from areas of high canopy cover as these areas are less degraded forest and act as a source population to more patchy or destroyed areas. This would be represented in our model as net biomass movement as a function of percentage change in canopy cover between the two sides of the traps. If patterns are detected, they could be used to predict insect movements across landscapes using environmental data only to try to identify source and sink populations for different orders.","2015-04-20","2015-07-20",FALSE,FALSE,"",104,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-117","The impact of altered forest microclimate on the development rate of mosquito vectors","P1011719-150x150.jpg","e.psomas14@imperial.ac.uk","Human modified landscape changes such as deforestation, logging and conversion to agriculture have been associated with increased risk of mosquito-borne diseases (Norris et al. 2004, Hahn et al. 2014, Saxena et al. 2014, Srivastava et al. 2013). Land use changes such as open forest areas have been reported as favourable environments for mosquitoes therefore increasing the risk of spread of malaria vector habitats (Srivastava et al. 2013). Establishment of new malaria vector habitats may therefore play a critical role in malaria transmission in previously malaria free regions (Sexana et al. 2014, Srivastava et al. 2013, Norris 2004). Mosquito vectors have four main lifecycle stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The first three stages form the juvenile stage, which is entirely aquatic and therefore intimately associated with the environment. Although the juvenile stage is not involved in mosquito-borne disease transmission, environmental conditions experienced during larval development determine development rate and survival of adult mosquitoes (Beck-Johnson et al. 2013, Couret et al. 2014). Changes in the development rate can therefore have important implications on the capacity of adult mosquitoes to transmit disease. Environmental variation in larval habitat quality including temperature has been shown to alter the biological competence of malaria vectors and therefore have important implications for the control of vector-borne diseases (Moller-Jacobs et al. 2014, Paaijmans et al. 2008, Takken et al. 2013). Mosquitoes are highly sensitive to their environment and therefore tropical deforestation and land-use changes can have important implications on mosquito vector population dynamics and vectorial capacity. Specific objectives are 1) Determine the development rate and survival of mosquito larvae collected in the field. 2) Quantify simple proxies of adult Vectorial capacity (proportion surviving to adult stage and body size) to determine how we may predict these changes in environment to indirectly impact the transmission of disease.","The project will involve the use of oviposition traps to sample mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). Oviposition traps will be set up along the second order spatial scale, already established in the following three sample sites: Old growth control (OG2 and OG3 located in the Maliau Basin Conservation Area), Oil Palm control (OP1 and OP3) and twice-logged rainforest (block D and E located within the SAFE Project field site). Old growth and oil palm sites each contain 9 sampling plots, whereas twice-logged sites block D and E each contain 16 sampling plots, with three replicates at each sample plot, this gives a total sample size of 204. Once oviposition traps have been set up, oviposition substrates will be collected (after ~ one week) and bought back to the field lab so that mosquito eggs can be counted. After counting, unhatched eggs will be placed in plastic containers (of equal size) filled with standardized water of equal volume and food supplements (Tertafin, fish food) of equal quantities. The plastic containers will be returned back into the field to the same sample plot where they were collected (placed in holes dug in the ground), in order to measure the mosquito survival and development rate under field microclimatic conditions. Once the mosquitoes have developed into pupae, the plastic containers will be covered with a mesh cloth, so that the adult mosquitoes do not escape. Once emerged, adults will be brought back to the field lab for identification. The water from each plastic container will be drained so that the adult mosquitoes can be placed in a freezer. Adult mosquitoes will then be transferred into eppendorf tubes and left to dry in a bag of silica gel until the mosquitoes can be identified. The larval survival and development rate will be measured by recording the proportion that emerge at each development stage (larva, pupa and adult) along with the number of transition days between each development stage. This will involve daily monitoring in the field. Adult mosquito body size is associated with adult wing length (Nasci, 1990) therefore adult wing length (of each adult mosquito collected) will be a simple proxy used to measure adult vectorial capacity. Body size has been suggested to influence adult feeding behaviour and survivorship, both of which are key determinants of transmission potential (Ameneshewa & Service, 1996, Takken et al. 1998). Microclimate daterloggers (ibuttons) previously established will be used to monitor temperature, humidity and soil moisture for use as supporting information in analyses of mosquito community structure. Human landing captures will not be used as a sampling method for collecting mosquitoes in this project. The analyses of this project will focus on the most common mosquito vectors collected, which are expected to include mosquitoes in the genera Aedes, Anopheles, Culex and Mansonia (Rattanarithikul et al. 2005). They are considered to be the most medically important mosquito vectors involved in the transmission of Dengue Fever (Aedes), Malaria (Anopheles), Japanese Encephalitis (Culex) and Filariasis (Mansonia) (Rattanarithikul et al. 2005, Yi et al. 2014).","2015-05-01","2015-07-13",FALSE,FALSE,"",121,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|Infectious Diseases|Microclimate|"
"SAFE-PRJ-118","Drivers of microclimate variation in disturbed forests","","bblonder@gmail.com","Plants and other organisms experience environmental variation at fine spatial and temporal scales. Variation in this microclimate can lead to large changes in organismal performance or fitness, e.g. plant seedling establishment probability, lizard/insect activity profiles, migration response to climate change, carbon uptake, etc. In particular if any environmental response functions are nonlinear (e.g. photosynthesis vs. temperature) then variation in environment over space or time can lead to disproportionate impacts for organisms.Logging and other types of disturbance are likely to dramatically shift microclimate in tropical forests due to changing light environments, topography, evaporation, and the functional properties of surviving/immigrating organisms. However the specific factors that predict microclimate variation, as well as their consequences, are poorly known except in some exemplary cases. Given the increased impacts of these disturbances across landscapes and the coarse resolution of many remotely-sensed climate/weather products used to describe the environments within these forests, there is a need to better predict the causes and consequences of microclimate variation across disturbance gradients.Here I propose to use the B-South and E SAFE carbon plots and the Maliau Belian carbon plot to measure thermal variation at the forest floor (relevant to seedling establishment, insect activity, etc.) at 1-5m spatial and 20 minute temporal resolution. These data will be obtained via mass deployment of hundreds of temperature dataloggers. I will pair this data with the tree census and functional trait/LIDAR data being collected by T. Riutta and the BALI consortium to ask the following questions: 1) what are the spatial and temporal scales over which climate variation occurs? 2) how does increasing disturbance intensity shift the above patterns? 3) how does topography, light environment, forest structure, and/or functional traits predict these patterns?","Maxim iButton DS1921G Thermochron ‘iButton’ loggers were selected. These sensors were programmed to record temperature every 20 minutes for 2048 intervals (~30 days). Each iButton was wrapped in approximately 1 inch x 2 inch of Parafilm. This packet was then wrapped in 1 inch x 1.5 inches of duct tape and a piece of yellow string. Each logger was labeled in permanent marker with a location code on front and back. The packet was then tied loosely onto the stake, and attached tightly with a plastic zip-tie. The logger was approximately 1 cm above the level of the soil or litter layer. Each logger was on a stake approximately 20-30cm long, painted either red, red-blue-pink, or red-pink-yellow, and sometimes with flagging on the stake or at 1m height immediately adjacent to the stake.Loggers were placed at every subplot corner (36 in B-south, 36 in Maliau Belian, 38 in E), every litterfall trap (25), and in three focal subplots per plot (6 per subplot, 18 per plot). There were therefore a total of 79 loggers installed at B-south and Maliau Belian, and 81 in E (239 in total).In focal subplots, the six additional loggers were placed in a cross pattern, two ‘up, N’ from the litter trap by 1m and 3m, two ‘down, S’ from the litter trap by 1m and 3m, one ‘left, W’ of the litter trap by 3m, and one ‘right, E’ of the litter trap by 3m. (There are not left 1m and right 1m because of lack of loggers, not because of scientific reasons). Each of these loggers were named as if ‘up’ corresponds to north. In some cases ‘up’ does not correspond to magnetic north, even though the loggers are labeled as such (e.g. in the Belian plot, ‘up’ and the vector from N1 to N3 corresponds to a magnetic bearing of 315°. Loggers and stakes were removed 30-45 days after installation. Loggers were then unwrapped and downloaded. Data were then cleaned, aligned, and kriged to produce thermal variation maps at 1-5m spatial resolution and 20 minute temporal resolution for the Nov – Dec 2015 period.

Yet, the relative contribution of coarse woody debris to carbon stocks in logged tropical forests remains poorly documented. Decomposition of dead wood contributes to carbon emissions originating from forests, and the magnitude of this contribution will depend on the variation in coarse woody debris stocks due to forest type and age, mortality pulses induced by drought or diseases, by topography affecting tree mortality, and the land use history and management of an area. Logging infrastructure and residual canopy damage can dominate carbon emissions in logged forests. Logging events accelerate the formation of coarse woody debris, from which carbon is released as decomposition progresses. The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of carbon stored across live trees and deadwood, and in particular across a land use gradient and in response to experimental habitat fragmentation. Specific objectives are: (1) Map pre-fragmentation carbon stocks and underlying environmental drivers (e.g. logging history, topography, forest edge effects on tree mortality) across land-use gradients in space and time, (2) Quantify the impacts of forest modification on live tree and deadwood carbon stocks at landscape scale, (3) Investigate the implications of logging and fragmentation on rates of carbon sequestration, carbon emissions through deadwood decomposition and rates of deadwood decay.","This project will be conducted in the experimental landscape situated in the East Malaysian state of Sabah. It will form part of a long-term, multi-disciplinary study of the effects of forest fragmentation and oil palm plantation establishment in Borneo: the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) project. Permanent vegetation structure plots in the SAFE landscape were measured for above-ground biomass and deadwood volume in 2010 and 2011. We measured additional metrics of biophysical structure in 172 of these plots in 2012 and 2013 and collected data on deadwood density in 2014. These data were collected as pre-forest conversion data to establish a temporal control. In the wider landscape, there also exist spatial controls: twice-logged forest immediately to the north of the experimental landscape and, further afield, the Maliau Basin Conservation Area. The protocol follows standard sampling designs for measurements in the field. The scale of the plots (25 m x 25 m) matches the pixel resolution of high to moderate - spatial resolution satellite sensors (e.g. Landsat, SPOT, RapidEye) and hence allows for the development of upscaling algorithm linking satellite data and ground-based forest attributes. Estimates of live tree and deadwood carbon stocks are derived a plot scale in annual surveys. Above-ground biomass is derived from tree size using an improved pan-tropical algorithm. We estimate deadwood volume in each plot based on size and number of deadwood pieces. We convert deadwood volume to deadwood mass using deadwood density estimates measured across decay classes in the SAFE experimental landscape, following a standard protocol (available for others upon request). Deadwood mass and live tree biomass are converted to carbon assuming that dry-stem biomass of trees has a carbon content of 47.4%. We used 41.3% to convert biomass in oil palms to carbon content, based on findings from oil palm plantations of Sumatra and East Kalimantan, Indonesia. For the upscaling and map development, we will use a range of sensor data, including RapidEye TM sensor data acquired over the SAFE landscape in 2012 and provided to us via the European Space Agency (Category 1 User Agreement). The RS-MSI sensor acquires data in five spectral bands in a 12-bit radiometric spectral resolution: the blue (0.44 - 0.51 Âµm), green (0.52 - 0.59 Âµm), red (0.63 - 0.68 Âµm) and near-IR (0.76 - 0.85 Âµm) bands are very similar to the corresponding Landsat spectral bands, but the sensor has an additional red edge (0.69 - 0.73 Âµm). We will process these images (calibration, dark-object subtraction, cloud and cloud shadowing-masking) and compute standard spectral vegetation indices as well as texture indices for subsequent use in developing upscaling algorithms. We will use derived upscaling algorithms to map out forest biomass across the wider landscape of SAFE and Maliau. We will randomly select points located in different biomass classes in these maps, which we will then measure in the field (each year) for validating these biomass maps.","2010-01-01","2018-01-01",FALSE,FALSE,"",55,"|Plant Science|Ecology|Agriculture|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Microclimate|"

Ectoparasites are an important group that are often overlooked. Ectoparasites are important to forest ecology because their life history involves both vegetation to live on and animals to feed on, and so any change that affects either the forest structure or the abundance of mammals will likely affect them too. Several species of ectoparasites around the world can also transmit important diseases, and so understanding their response to forest modification could be important in disease control. I will investigate the diversity, density and biomass of ticks and leeches across a gradient of habitat modification, collecting ectoparasites from the ground and understory level. A paucity of information on ectoparasite responses to forest modification makes predictions very difficult. It is possible their density may increase with logging of forest, corresponding to an increased host species density in these modified fragments. Moreover, we might also expect possible that body sizes will be increased in logged relative to primary forests, as the increased structural complexity of low-level logged forest may assist ticks and leeches avoid predators. I will investigate (1) how tick and leech density and biomass varies across a gradient of forest modification including primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. (2) What other abiotic factors are also correlated or not with forest modification and whether these factors correlate or not with changes in parasite density and biomass.","I'll be working on the first order spatial scale to collect as much data as possible within a 10 week period from early May onwards. Methods for collecting leeches and ticks will mostly involve pushing a white cloth along the ground and/or through the shrubbery for a predetermined standard distance and counting/weighing the individuals which grab onto the cloth. I will be collecting samples of leeches and ticks from quadrats in the sample sites; they will be counted on site. The leeches will also have their body lengths measured and both leeches and ticks will be identified to species. In conjunction with each ectoparasite sample, I will record the average height of the ground layer, ground soil moisture and acidity, air temperature in the understory, and a measure of ground and shrub layer structural diversity such as a measure of leaf frequency at various heights above ground level or the average area of a random selection of leaves in the quadrat. The average height of the ground layer and structural diversity is important as it is the habitat of the ectoparasites in question and there may be a clear relationship between these figures and the density of leeches and ticks. The moisture levels, air temperature and soil acidity are also important at dictating the microclimate and the suitability of a particular quadrat to the ectoparasites, particularly leeches which prefer moist conditions. I will analyse the results of the study using an ANCOVA on the statistical programme R. The different types of forest modification are hypothesised to be the main cause of differences in the ectoparasite community but measurements of temperature, humidity and soil and leaf surface water are important during each sample to eliminate the possibility that other factors have an effect.","2012-05-03","2012-07-16",FALSE,TRUE,"",22,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|Infectious Diseases|"

Many studies have evaluated changes in biomass stocks in tropical forests using re-censuses of field plots (Chave et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2008). At large scales of 10-1000 km, changes in climate and geological substrate explain variation in old-growth forest type and structure (Laurance et al., 1999). At intermediate scales of 100 m - 10 km, forest structure is strongly associated with variation in water availability, soils and disturbance (Toledo et al., 2012). And at local scales of 10-100 m, gap dynamics leads to patchiness related to time since the last large treefall (Kellner and Asner, 2009). Our main questions are: How to separate variability due to biotic interactions from variability that arises from interaction with the environment? Are spatial patterns of forest change similar to the topographic distributions of biomass change? What variable most contribute to biomass change? Do these changes correspond with previous hypothesis about the effects of climate change? Our approach involves airborne LiDAR mapping to calibrate measurements and provide maps of above-ground biomass, carbon and emission densities across this landscape.","Lidar Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are able to capture the complex three-dimensional (3-D) structure of forest canopies and underlying ground surface topography at very high spatial resolutions, and have been highly effective for forest biomass estimation and other properties of forest ecosystems (Reutebuch et al., 2005; Frazer et al., 2011). Field estimates need to be collected with LiDAR to develop regression models to describe the relationship between field-measured variables of interest (response) and one or more LiDAR metrics (predictors). Once calibrated and validated, LiDAR can be used as to spatially extend model predictions of the target variable across all areas of the land base where LiDAR data were captured ( Nasset and Gobakken, 2008; Garci­a et al., 2010). Plot size can either lower or inflate predictions leading to biased results when using LiDAR ground metrics. When plots are small, single large tree located just outside the plot boundary (i.e. not included in the sample) may have a large portion of its crowns falling within the plots (Fraser et al., 2011). We expect that larger plot size will reduce the impact of plot boundaries, especially for larger crowns, and increase stability of LiDAR metrics. In this project, we will also investigate the influences of plot size on the accuracy and precision of biomass estimation by LiDAR and determine the sampling efficiency and optimal size in Malaysia under different conditions. We expect to understand the influences of topography and gap frequency on plot size and sampling efficiency for biomass estimation using LiDAR and how accurate estimations are under these different conditions. There are 193 plots of 25 x 25 m with the SAFE project and we will extend 50 plots to compound a subset to 45m x 45m to compare the differences in terms of accuracy and precision of model prediction. We will also resurvey plots in riverine areas to investigate biomass in these areas and calibrate our LiDAR-based models. For plot establishment and re-measurement we will follow the well-established RAINFOR protocols (http://www.rainfor.org/en). In each plot we will measure the diameter at breast height (DBH) for all trees > 10.0 cm using a measurement tape, total height of stems using an electronic clinometer, as well as identifying tree species to either species or genus level. Wood density values for each species or genus will be compiled from Brown (1997) and the World Agroforestry Center's Wood Density Database (ICRAF, 2008). Great attention must be paid to the choice of allometric equation that will be used to avoid propagation of error for biomass estimates. The equations that include DBH, wood density and height will be assumed to be the most appropriate for subsequent analyses.","2015-06-21","2015-10-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",97,"|Ecology|"

As the sphere of anthropogenic influence continues to expand, natural tropical forests are being displaced by human-modified landscapes, resulting in biodiversity loss and the potential breakdown of ecosystem services. Ecosystem service orientated policies, such as REDD+, have emerged as a popular strategy to mitigate tropical forest loss and seek to assign economic value to natural capital, thus providing financial incentives for conservation. One key assumption to REDD+ is the delivery of ecological co-benefits, whereby forest protection/restoration to enhance carbon stocks will also conserve biodiversity. Global-scale analyses have highlighted the potential for tropical regions to deliver win-win conservation outcomes, yet the coarse-scale methodologies adopted mask local variation. Consequently, further investigation is required to determine spatial concordance between ecosystem services and biodiversity at the scale of a typical conservation management unit. Medium to large terrestrial mammals represent a model study system for such an investigation since they have substantial ecological roles in tropical forest ecosystems, are frequently prioritised by conservation assessments, and can serve as flagship species to reflect the needs of other taxa. Furthermore, their numerical and distributional spatial signatures over a landscape may reflect a cause or effect of compromised ecosystem functioning. My PhD research at SAFE will address these concerns by assessing the spatial congruence between mammalian diversity and forest carbon stocks at a fine-scale across the landscape. In doing so, I aim to understand the ecological response of tropical forest mammals to a gradient of disturbance across a modified tropical landscape, but also the extent to which this variation in mammal diversity is associated with carbon provisions prioritised by REDD+ policies.","Mammal Surveys: A double-pronged camera trap protocol utilising Reconyx units will sample terrestrial mammals across second order points in the SAFE experimental landscape and surrounding oil palm estates. Initially, the spatial coverage of the random encounter model design established at SAFE (Wearn and Ewers) will be extended to previously neglected forest blocks and riparian zones, providing a platform to assess fragmentation effects more broadly post-clearance. Subsequently, a complimentary landscape-level occupancy design will be employed to assess the distributional, numerical and behavioural response of tropical forest mammals relative to forest structure and landscape covariates within a Bayesian analytical framework. I will adopt a single-season community-level occupancy design using a traditional gridded methodology (1.5km spacing between camera trap units) with directed placement towards low resistance travel routes to assess mammal ecology across 130 sites (65 within oil palm and 65 within fragmented forest). This dual approach will further facilitate methodological comparison between the random encounter and occupancy models in terms of species accumulation and taxonomic bias. Camera trapping will be supplemented with the deployment of SM2 Songmeter units (Wildlife Acoustics) in an attempt to determine cost-effective acoustic proxies for mammalian richness and diversity. Recording units will be established in corresponding plots and riparian zones and operate for up to seven consecutive days. Bespoke coding procedures in the statistical software package R will be used to quantify auditory metrics of species diversity.Carbon Stock Assessment: Carbon provisions across the SAFE experimental area and Benta Wawasan oil palm estates will be mapped using the High Carbon Stock (HCS) approach, in conjunction with project partners at The Forest Trust and Greenpeace. HCS is an industry-standard land-use planning tool, employed to stratify the landscape according to vegetation density, and thus carbon value, using supervised classification and visual interpretation techniques on remotely-sensed satellite imagery. HCS strata will be validated via extension of the core SAFE vegetation plots into additional riparian areas following standardised RAINFOR forest inventory protocols. Detailed camera trap data will be spatially interpolated and used to verify the biodiversity value of HCS strata. This component of the project will be conducted in collaboration with other SAFE project researchers (Pfeifer, Wearn and Ewers).
Spatial Planning: The combined mammal and carbon dataset will allow for spatial prioritisation analyses across the forest oil palm landscape managed by Benta Wawasan, and help us explore the implications of various land-use options (for example under land-sparing versus land-sharing assumptions) on biodiversity and ecosystem services. For this I will utilise spatial planning approaches (e.g. Marxan) to examine the potential trade-offs between oil palm planting, carbon provisioning and the distribution (e.g. encounters/occupancy, and/or distribution modelling) and connectivity (e.g. Circuitscape) of mammal populations over the landscape.","2015-03-09","2018-04-08",FALSE,FALSE,"",45,"|Biodiversity|Plant Science|Zoology|Ecology|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Microclimate|Policy|"

They often come to dominate forests degraded by heavy logging, and their habit of smothering seedlings and impeding tree regeneration make them unpopular with timber companies and conservationists engaged in restoration activites forests. Intriguingly, they have also markedly increased in abundance within inventory plots scattered across old-growth tropical forests, perhaps because their physiological capable of rapid response to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The implications of increased liana abundance for old-growth forest dynamics are potentially profound, since they link individual trees together such that the death of one individual can cause neighbours to be pulled down, which creates further opportunities for liana growth and a positive feedback loop. Despite their importance in forest responses to global change, the ecology of tropical liana remains poorly understood. We know remarkably little about the environmental factors affecting their distribution, or their ecophysiological functioning.","The NERC Airborne Remote Sensing Facility (NERC-ARSF) has recently mapped 40 km2 of logged and old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia, using a high-resolution imaging spectrometer. This state-of-the-art spectrometer quantifies reflectance of radiation within 400 wavebands spanning the visible and near infrared. Lianas are known to have a distinctive spectral “signature” to other elements of the forest canopy, meaning that it should be possible to map their abundance across human-modified and intact forests. In order to produce these maps, extensive fieldwork will be required to quantify liana abundance in plots scattered within the survey area, to measure the functional traits of different liana species, and to collect spectra from individual leaves to compare with those collected by the aircraft's. The maps we produce will be use to test hypotheses regarding liana abundance, including hypotheses on the impacts of logging and soil characteristics.","2016-01-01","2016-12-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",130,"|Plant Science|Ecology|Soil Science|"

The area where the plot is located will be converted into oil palm plantation during 2015-2017 (for commercial purposes, not for research). The overarching aim of the project is to assess how the termination of the transport of sugars and defoliation alter forest ecosystem functioning and structure.The aim of the project is:
1. To quantify the contribution of photosynthate supply to soil processes: fine root productivity, soil CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes, fine root dynamics, soil nitrogen and phosphorus pools, microbial community?
2. To assess the carbon budget, carbon allocation, water transport and water use within individual trees.
3. To assess the functional role of non-structural carbohydrates (energy storage and/or osmotic regulation) by quantifying them before and after tree death.
4. To quantify the effect of defoliation on forest microclimate: light environment, turbulence, temperature and humidity.
5. To develop and calibrate methods for determining leaf area with terrestrial laser scanning (T-Li-Dar), by taking scan in foliated and defoliated conditions, and to determine the spectral signature dying trees.The study will provide new insights into and knowledge on tropical forest ecosystem functioning in relation to soil processes, carbon and water budgets of trees and non structural carbohydrates.","To address these aims, we propose to girdle the trees in one half of the plot (0.5 ha), leaving the other half (0.5 ha) as a control. In girdling, a strip of bark (including cambium and phloem) is removed from around the trunk, with the aim of stopping the transport of sugars from the foliage into the roots and soil. The transport of sugars stop immediately, allowing us to quantify their role in the root and soil processes. The girdled trees will gradually defoliate and die due to the carbon starvation of the roots. We wish to emphasise that these trees would have been felled anyway during the conversion to oil palm - this project is not causing any additional deforestation.
The processes measured are:
- Net primary productivity (woody, canopy and fine root productivity) measured with tree census, dendrometer bands that monitor the change in tree circumference, litter traps that collect litter fall, hemispherical photographs, and root ingrowth cores and rhizotrons (root windows in the soil)
- CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from soil measured with portable chambers from which a gas sample is drawn and analysed in the field with a portable instrument (CO2) or in the laboratory (CH4 and N2O).
- Sap flow measured with automatic, non-destructive sensors.
- Changes in tree circumference monitored with automatic dendrometer bands.
- Terrestrial laser scanning (T-lidar), non-destructive method to quantify the 3D structure of the forest stand.Pre-girdling data of all processes will be collected, starting at least two months before the girdling. The girdling is proposed to take place in early 2016, and the monitoring will continue for six to twelve months afterwards, depending on how long it takes for the processes to respond and for the trees to die.","2015-12-01","2017-05-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",129,"|Plant Science|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Biogeochemistry|Microclimate|"
"SAFE-PRJ-124","Biological diversity and ecological changes in wood decaying fungi communities following tropical forests logging and conversion into oil palm plantations","IMG_9720-110x110.jpg","jsathiyaseelan807@gmail.com","Tropical forests are seriously threatened by habitat fragmentation, forest degradation and conversion of natural forest to agro-industrial plantation (Dirzo and Raven, 2003; Hansen et al. 2010). This has decreased the available habitat for wide range of species and altered the ecosystem function at large and small scales (Paz et al. 2015). Species habitat loss for different taxonomic groups (plants, animals, invertebrates, lichens and etc.) has been primarily focused on temperate and boreal forests (Seibold 2015). In temperate and boreal region, observational and experimental studies contributed evidence-based conservation strategies (Seibold 2015). However, in the tropics or subtropics, the ecological roles of different taxonomic groups due to forest conversion into plantations, are not well studied (Lodge and Cantrell 1995; Seibold 2015).Forest accumulates huge amounts of dead wood. Dead wood or coarse woody debris (CWD) is an essential component in forest ecosystems for a wide range of organisms, including both saproxylic and non-saproxylic species. They maintain carbon store in long term, provide nutrients and habitat to large number of organisms. Wood-decaying fungi are considered as saproxylic taxa which are one of the diverse groups but least understood (Boddy et al. 2008; Stokland et al. 2012). The ecological relationships between dead wood and fungi (primary and secondary colonizers) are complex but fascinating. Wood-decaying fungi play central roles as decomposers (white rot or brown rot) in the forest ecosystems. They are mainly saprotrophic species as the main decomposers of complex lignin molecules, cellulose and hemicellulose (Okino et al. 2002). Numerous studies showed that the diversity of wood-decaying fungi decreased rapidly with increasing management intensity or logging activities in the temperate regions (Penttila et al. 2004). The loss of habitat and the decrease of dead wood have also had negative effects on wood-decaying fungi (Laaksonen et al. 2008; Pietrek and Branch 2011). Various wood-decaying fungal species prefer different substrates. In addition, primary and secondary colonizers differ at different stages of decay, meaning that complete decomposition process depends crucially on fungal diversity (Osono 2007). The wood-decaying fungi in the tropical forests are still less well documented especially in Southeast Asia (Lodge and Cantrell 1995; Lachat et al. 2006; Seibold et al. 2015). With the alarming rates of forest conversion into oil palm plantation, we may lose important ecosystem services and biological diversity before they can even be described. Reduction of CWD in forests has reduced saproxylic organisms and 40% listed as threatened species in European country like Finland (Penttilla et al. 2006; Kebli et al. 2011). Thus, major distribution and documentation of wood-decaying fungi (agarics, polypores and corticioid) in Borneo especially in Sabah, is still unexplored. Complete observational and experimental studies using wood-decay fungi as a biological model would be very helpful to predict the consequences of forest degradation and measures for conservation strategies.The main objectives of this study are to
(i) investigate the diversity and species composition of wood-decaying fungi in disturbed and undisturbed habitats
(ii) investigate the substrate specificity among the wood-decaying fungi                                                                         (iii) investigate the temporal variation in wood-decaying fungi fructification of different habitats (old growth forest, logged and unlogged forest and oil palm plantation sites)                                                                                                        (iv) investigate the species delimitation using multigene phylogeny between native agarics, polypores, and corticioid fungi.","We will set up 88 sampling plots along transects in all management category sites (i.e. Old growth controls, Logged forest controls, Logged forest edge, Virgin Jungle Reserve, Fragments block A, Fragments block B, Fragments block C, Fragments block D, Fragments block E, Fragments block F, Oil Palm Control, Riparian Strips) with a distance between plots of 100m (logged: 24 plots; disturbed: 36 plots; Old -growth: 28 plots). The sampling trip will be conducted during Nov-Jan, March-May, and July-September for a year. We will record wood-decaying fungi in 0.1 ha plots on fallen tree logs with a diameter ≥ 10cm. The abundance of each species will be estimated as the number of logs on which the species will be found. Several living or recently dead fruiting bodies also will be collected opportunistically outside of the plots. Once trees and logs to be sampled are identified, they will be tagged, their location within the plot will be recorded, and fungi will be sampled using cultural and metagenomics approaches. Abiotic and biotic variables will be obtained from SAFE for each plot. Besides that, GPS coordinates, temperature, humidity, elevation, number of fruiting bodies, seasonal collection dates will be recorded for every month. All fungal fruiting bodies will be photographed, labelled, and dried using food dryer at 45ºC and kept in the herbarium for taxonomic identification and for molecular analyses. Pieces of each dead wood sample collected from plots will be cultured on agar media to obtain pure cultures for further genetic analysis. To the extent possible, micromorphological features (spores, cystidia, and hyphal constructions) will be studied while at field stations. Morphological analysis and taxonomic research will be concentrating on wood-decaying Agaricomycotina, particularly polypores and corticioid fungi and some ascomycete. Therefore, molecular approaches will be attempted to generate a multigene phylogeny to know if there are any novel lineages within this group that are endemic to Sabah.","2015-11-09","2016-11-09",FALSE,FALSE,"",46,"|Biodiversity|Ecology|Soil Science|"
"SAFE-PRJ-125","The effect of tropical forest modification on primate population density and diversity.","Trachypithecus-cristatus-150x150.jpg","m.j.struebig@kent.ac.uk","Many of Borneo's primate species are considered threatened by the IUCN on the basis of reduced population size from ongoing habitat loss and degradation. Yet surprisingly there are few estimates of population density in disturbed habitats from which to base these claims. While deforestation clearly leads to a near extirpation of some primate taxa (e.g. orang-utan), other species seem to persist in non-forest lands including appropriately managed oil palm estates. The extent to which heavily degraded forest landscapes (i.e. intensively logged and fragmented) can support viable primate populations has received little scrutiny to date, as most published inventories and density estimates have focused in near-pristine protected areas, primarily in Kalimantan (e.g. for maroon langur and Müller's gibbon). In part this is because reliable density estimates can be difficult to obtain for species that are wide-ranging, gregarious and rarely encountered. Surveys require substantial sampling effort and specialised density estimation methods that ideally should be standardised across the species range.This project will address this gap by sampling primates over the SAFE project landscape during and after forest conversion. Our joint research between UMS and DICE builds upon previous pre-clearance surveys between 2012 and 2014, and will quantify distribution and assemblage structure to inform a forthcoming biodiversity evaluation as part of the LOMBOK consortium. Further, we will apply some recently adapted distance-sampling methodologies for a subset of taxa - primarily langurs, gibbons and the orang-utan. A key question we seek to address is whether estimates of primate population density can indeed be associated with forest modification. Placing findings from SAFE in the context of density estimates obtained from other Bornean sites will help in this task.","We will establish a network of 1.5-2.0 km primate transects across the SAFE landscape and surrounding oil palm estates, in habitats representative of the full gradient of disturbance from forest to oil palm. We aim to resample many of the original transects sampled pre-clearance, but also seek additional replication elsewhere so that we can obtain separate density estimates for different habitat types (e.g. logged forest, logged/fragmented forest, riparian areas). As much as possible we will match transects to 2nd order and 3rd order points and associated vegetation plot data.Transects will be walked multiple times by 1-2 trained teams spaced >750m apart. All primate encounters will be recorded and information such as group size and distance from observer noted. We will then estimate detection functions per species and generate population density estimates via standard distance-sampling procedures. Indirect encounters via vocalisations (e.g. gibbons) and nests (e.g. orangutan) will also be recorded, and commonly used adaptations to the analytical approach used to generate density estimates for key taxa (e.g. orangutan nest count decay, Ancrenaz 2004 PLoS Biology; gibbon vocalisation triangulation Gilhooly 2015 International Journal Primatology).Alongside the transect sampling we may supplement the core SAFE vegetation data to quantify habitat characteristics and link with core spatial information that could help predict primate encounters.","2016-04-01","2018-12-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",117,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|"

In logged forest, their numbers appear to drop off drastically, putting more pressure on other taxa to fill the roles that termites usually hold.Despite there being a large amount of data on the decline in termite abundance and diversity within logged, the reasons behind this decline have not been extensively studied. Two of the major changes to the microclimate that occur within logged forest is the increase of temperature, and the decrease of humidity, factors that should have a large effect on the fitness of the small ectotherms. This project will test the thermotolerance, and the tolerance to decreasing humidity, of different termite species, to see which (if any) are more resilient to the changing conditions that occur with logging, and climate change. Furthermore, it will be able to identify whether the variation is intraspecific or interspecific, which could be used to predict the future abundance and distribution of different termite species with the changing climate.","Termites will be collected from a site and placed into a dark cool-box to prevent desiccation (with their substrate). All species present in both Maliau and the SAFE project will be collected, and multiple colonies of the same species, from multiple different sites, will be sampled. The type of termite will change the collection method, for mound-building and wood dwelling termites a portion of their structure will be removed and placed in the box, for soil dwelling they will simply be dug up. Where possible, termites will be collected from plots located near to climate loggers, to get the most accurate measure of local microclimate possible. Additional data such as the immediate air temperature and humidity will also be taken.Once collected they will be brought back to the lab, and the experimental methods will follow those laid out by Terblanche et al., (2011). The termites will be removed from their substrate and placed in groups of 10 into a tube with a small portion (5g) of their substrate. All 10 termites will be the same species collected from the same colony. This tube will then be placed in a water bath, which is slowly heated. The temperature at which half the termites have died will be recorded. The second experiment will be altering humidity. 10 termites will be placed in a tube, but without their substrate present, with a varying amount of silica gel. The tubes will be placed in a water bath at a constant temperature, and the time that it takes for half the termites to die will be recorded. Both experiments will be repeated multiple times for each colony collected, as it is expected that many termites will be collected from each colony.
All termites in both experiments will then be removed from the tube and placed into individual Eppendorf tubes containing alcohol for preservation.

Specifically, I aim to: (1) trap, sex and tag individuals to assess the population dynamics of the Whitehead' s Rat population in the area .(2) Map home ranges of individual and determine whether the size and spatial distribution of these alters in response to disturbance. (3) Assess whether changes in dispersal and spatial distribution of individuals caused by disturbance are linked with any changes in health or condition (i.e. parasite load) (4) Assess, using a handheld spectrophotometer, whether changes in pelage colouration could effect the unexpected persistence of Whitehead's rat.","The proposed area will be the landscape (designed by S.A.F.E) that is currently being converted from logged forest into oil palm plantation by Benta Wawasan, experimentally setting the size and location of remnant forest fragments. To establish a temporal control on the land use change process, I have access to approximately 18 months of pre-conversion data on a whole host of ecosystem properties at various spatial scales, as well as existing data on the distribution and abundance of mammals collected by a former PhD student Oliver Wearn prior to the conversion process. This project continues with the same sampling design for live trapping as Oliver used, and therefore allows a long-term evaluation of changes to Whitehead's Rat communities through the disturbance and fragmentation process. In the wider landscape, I will also make use of spatial controls: twice-logged forest immediately to the north of the experimental landscape, surrounding oil palm plantations and, further afield, the primary forest at the Maliau Basin Conservation Area. Mammalian communities will be censused with three main techniques:1. The main methodology used in this project will be direct trapping of Whitehead's Rat (using 'Tomahawk'-style cage traps). Traps will be baited with oil palm seeds (a food it displays preference for) and checked daily (between 7am and 9am). Individuals caught for the first time in a trapping session will be anaesthetised using diethylether (which has no apparent long-term effects), injected with a unique PIT tag for future identification, and released at the point of capture. Any species other than Whitehead's Rat shall be release upon capture. Tagged individuals will be given a fur clip on the left leg in order to facilitate identification of re-captures during subsequent trapping days. Any injuries resulting from trap doors and tag injectors will be disinfected thoroughly before releasing animals. For the trapped animals, densities will be derived from conventional mark-recapture statistical methods.
2. Upon capture, individuals shall also be sexed, parasite load assessed, and the colouration of their pelage evaluated using a handheld spectrophotometer.
These sampling techniques will be used across land-use gradients in space (in primary, logged and fragmented forest) and in time (in continuous logged forest and, post-conversion, in fragments of logged forest of three sizes: 1 ha, 10 ha, and 100ha). Traps will be run in sampling grids set up by Oliver Wearn, each centred on a pair of second-order sampling points (see Ewers et al (2011) for details of the sampling design). Each grid comprises 96 traps, and a total of 12 grids (2 each within oil palm plantations and in the primary forest at Maliau Basin, and eight within the fragment system) will be run for 7 days each.","2016-03-16","2016-07-26",FALSE,FALSE,"",106,"|Zoology|Ecology|Infectious Diseases|"

"SAFE-PRJ-129","The role of competition in structuring ant community composition across a tropical forest disturbance gradient.","Ant_close_0712_small-110x110.jpg","ross.gray12@imperial.ac.uk","Understanding the processes that drive community assembly and how they may be impacted by change is a central theme in community ecology. Processes such as competition and environmental filtering have been shown to give rise to patterns of communities. Ant communities often show hierarchical structuring, yet the relationship between competitive processes and the patterns of community composition have not been fully examined. Ants are highly functional organisms playing vital roles in processes such as soil turnover, predation, herbivory, seed dispersal and scavenging. In tropical rainforests, ants monopolise an estimated 25% of animal biomass (Schultz, 2000), and on Borneo alone over 1,000 species have been recorded (Pfeiffer et al., 2011). This level of biomass, abundance and functionality is why ants are considered some of the most cost-effective indicators of forest disturbance (Gardner et al., 2008). Borneo has and still is experiencing arguably unparalleled forest modification. Studies that inform our understanding of the processes that structure functionally important species communities and how these might be perturbed as a result of forest modification are both timely and important. The project addresses three main questions:1) Does competition structure ant communities in pristine old growth forest?
2) What is the relationship between competition and community composition observed?
3) Does this relationship change across a forest modification gradient?","The project will look at two aspects of litter-dwelling ant communities in each site (old growth, twice-logged and oil palm): (1) interspecific competition and (2) composition.1) At 8 sampling locations, bait cards will be placed and observed to quantify aspects of competition in ant species communities. At each point location, 9 laminated graph paper bait cards will be placed in line with the soil surface in a 3×3 grid, with 5 meter spacings. Three variable bait sizes will be used to avoid confounding effects. The baits will be a mix of tuna and honey. Each bait card will be observed by eye, in a random order, for 10 minutes. Photographs of the bait cards will also be taken every 30 seconds. Observations will take place at three times in a day to control for temporal changes. The interspecific competitive behaviour between ants will be assessed by recording: the order of arrival, the frequency of species at the bait and the aggression towards other ant species (Drescher et al., 2011; Del Toro et al., 2013). Aggression will be categorized as one of the following: dominant, where they force the other to retreat from the bait; submissive, where they flee from the bait when confronted or neutral, where they do not interact (Cerda et al., 1998; Del Toro et al., 2013). Voucher specimens will be hand-collected using forceps or pooters, for identification with guides in the field (e.g. Fayle et al., 2014) or later at the research centre and at the University of Malaysia Sabah.
2) At the same 8 sampling locations, community composition will be assessed by measuring species abundance and alpha-species richness. These metrics can then be used to calculate beta-diversity and species evenness across the three sites. The abundance and species richness will be sampled using Winkler bag extraction methods (Bestelmayer et al., 2000; Krell et al., 2005). At each point location a 25 x 25 meter sampling grid will be laid out. At each 5 meter grid point a 1 meter square quadrat will be placed and the leaf litter in that area will be extracted and placed in a sifter sack. The bags will be left to hang for 3 days, to allow any ants to exit the litter into the container at the bottom (Krell et al., 2005). Containers will be partially filled with 70%-ethanol solution.

The use of vocal individuality has been proposed to be an effective method to census rare or elusive species (Adi et al. 2010), and the use of bioacoustic techniques has been advocated as an effective, noninvasive technique to monitor populations (Terry et al. 2005). In all gibbon species that have been investigated, inter-individual differences in gibbon great calls have been shown to be greater than intra-individual differences (Dallmann and Geissmann 2009, Sun et al. 2011, Wanelik et al. 2013), indicating that the use of vocal fingerprints to monitor gibbon populations will likely be effective. Individuality of Bornean gibbon calls has been relatively unexplored, although preliminary analyses indicate that a high degree of individuality does exist (Clink, unpublished data).
The purpose of the current project is to utilize vocal fingerprints to census and monitor Bornean gibbons at the SAFE Project. Almost nothing is known about the short-term impacts of habitat fragmentation on gibbon behavior and ecology, and the design of the SAFE site will allow for a unique opportunity to investigate the effects of habitat fragmentation on gibbon ecology using an experimental framework. Most studies of primates in fragments focus on a single fragment, and no published study to-date has pre- and post- fragmentation data on the ecology of primates. If the proposed method of identification of individual groups via vocal fingerprints is effective, this will allow for the effective monitoring of gibbon groups and their locations before and after fragmentation, leading to a deeper understanding of how fragmentation influences endangered gibbons.","Recordings: All recordings will be taken between the hours of 05:30 am and 11:00 am. Recordings will not be taken during mornings when there is rain, as gibbon singing frequency is negatively correlated with rainfall (Hamard et al. 2010). Sound recordings will be made using a Marantz PMD 660 flash recorder equipped with a RODE NTG-2 directional condenser microphone. A GPS point of the recording location (using a Garmin eTrex 10 GPS), as well as the compass bearing and approximate distance of the group from the recording point, will be documented. Once a quality recording is taken, the PI will attempt to make visual contact with the group to determine group size, composition and any distinguishing features of individuals in the group.
Song Analysis: The songs of male gibbons tend to show a higher degree of variability in syntax (Dallmann and Geissmann 2001, 2009), so analysis of vocalizations will focus on the great call of the female gibbon. During the great call, males remain silent for approximately 10 seconds while the female sings. The great call is the longest and most standardized portion of female gibbon song. We will measure 27 variables for each great call, including the first formant (or fundamental frequency) of each note, duration of each note and total great call duration. Sonograms and measurements of vocalizations will be created using the program Praat (Version 5.3.41, http://www.praat.org/). Inter- and intra-individual variation will be analyzed using discriminant analysis.
Progress to Date: The PI has collected recordings of gibbon groups from plots B, C, F, VJR and the old growth controls (n=25 groups). Analysis and development of vocal fingerprints for gibbon groups at SAFE is currently underway.","2012-07-01","2015-09-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",133,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-130","Determining the importance of riparian reserves to maintain the dispersal of small mammals in a fragmented landscape in Sabah, Malaysia","2-12-Sub-adult-Whitehead-Maxomys-whiteheadi-110x110.jpg","syg12@ic.ac.uk","The rapid expansion of the palm oil industry in Malaysia and the removal of primary and logged forest have resulted in a loss of biodiversity and disruption of species' ranges. This could have disruptive consequences on small mammal communities, which play a key role in tropical humid forest ecosystems as prey items, carnivores, seed predators and dispersers. Riparian corridors provide a natural habitat matrix between forest fragments, which is assumed to maintain biodiversity and species connectivity. For this reason, government policy and legislation in Borneo currently retain experimentally designed riparian reserves. However, the biodiversity benefits of these riparian corridors in oil palm agricultural regions of Southeast Asia remain uncertain, as few studies have been conducted. Moreover, research examining their ability to support ecological functions such as dispersal is lacking. This was studied for birds in neotropical forests but has not previously been done for mammals, possibly due to inherent difficulties in sampling and collecting data on their dispersal patterns.
This project will address the key question of whether riparian corridors are sufficient to maintain dispersal of small mammal communities, a highly overlooked taxon in this field. I will analyse the dispersal patterns of small mammals in riparian strips within established oil palm plantations to determine whether riparian corridors sufficiently allow for dispersal of small mammals through plantations. Addressing this is necessary to help prevent further loss of biodiversity of tropical humid forests of Southeast Asia, as if riparian strips can effectively aid movement through palm oil plantations, this may help connect and help recolonise isolated populations in forest fragments. Furthermore, the outcomes of this project could have important implications on responsible management practices and conservation action plans in the oil palm plantations of the Sabah region.","The spool-and-line technique will be used over a four-month period to observe the efficacy with which small mammals are able to use riparian strips as dispersal corridors within a fragmented landscape. I will trap small mammals in transects along established riparian strips in mature oil palm plantations, using novel sites >1000m away from existing SAFE project sites to avoid conflict with other projects. These will include riparian strips of widths ranging from 10-120 metres. Control (continuous forest) sites will be set up along comparable rivers within the SAFE landscape, again >1000m from existing sampling sites.
At each site, Tomahawk-style steel cage traps baited with oil palm fruit will be set in transects of 20 traps at 15m intervals a constant distance from the edge of the riparian zone.  To avoid physiological stress to the mammals, these will be set only in well-shaded microhabitats in dense cover, and care will be taken to select sufficiently large and fresh bait to provide adequate nutrition (past studies in this field area show that large oil palm fruit are ample nutrition for all likely-captured species).
In this study I will analyse dispersal behaviour of murid rodents (rats and mice). Trapping transects will be checked and re-set each day at dusk. Animals caught will be identified, sexed and aged, and either released or retained for tracking, depending on several criteria. Firstly, treeshrews and squirrels will be released immediately; as well as being partly arboreal, these species are known (from previous small mammal trapping experience in this study area) to be too stress-prone to track. Rare species unlikely to provide sufficient sample sizes will also be released; this study will focus on common and resilient rats of the genus Maxomys. Within these species, I will only focus on adults and subadults, with vulnerable juveniles and pregnant females released. Lastly, animals will fit weight criteria such that any attached spool device does not exceed 5% of the individual's body weight. Animals over 40g will be tracked with a small spool (length=88m), while animals over 100g will use a large spool (length=220m). Animals below the 40g cutoff will be released. This ensures representative movement is observed, and meets widely-accepted ethical guidelines for tracking devices.
Animals to be tracked will be anaesthetised with diethyl ether to obtain biometric measurements (hind foot, ano-genital distance and weight), the sex, age and species for each individual. As well as providing back-up information in the case of uncertain ID, these data are important covariates of observed movement behaviour. Fine scale movements will be tracked by attaching a temporary lightweight bobbin of thread to the animal. A hair clip will be taken from the upper back region to provide a fur-based attachment point for the spool using cyanoacrylate gel glue. The spool will be double-wrapped in a cling-film layer that allows smooth unravelling, and then wound in a gaffer tape layer that avoids snagging on foliage. The total weight of the package will not exceed 5% of the average minimum weight of each species. Once processed, the individuals will be translocated from their site of capture by ~50m to a release site longitudinally along the same riparian reserve. The proximal end of the thread will be tied to a fixed or heavy structure such as the trap. As the animal is released from the trap, the freely unravelling thread will catch on vegetation and topography, revealing the movement patterns of the individual. The track will be divided into steps, with a step being defined as a length of the animal's track where it does not deviate from a straight line by more than 10 degrees. The length of steps and the angles between them will be measured and recorded using a tape measure and compass to construct a detailed two-dimensional map of each animal's route through space. From this, I will be able to obtain a measure of path tortuosity for each individual tracked. In addition to this, I will obtain measurements of forest canopy cover, vegetation type and habitat quality at set intervals along the track so to understand whether spatial selection of animals is also influenced by habitat structural components.
I will compare the two-dimensional dispersal patterns and path tortuosity of individuals tracked in riparian strips adjacent to oil palm to those of control sites. I will test the hypotheses that aspects of dispersal patterns including path tortuosity differ between study and control sites, and are affected by differences in habitat quality, riparian strip width and vegetation density.
Before starting fieldwork for this project I will be undertaking an intensive two-week course in mammal trapping procedures with PhD student Philip Chapman, who has five months of mammal trapping experience in this study area. This training will include the fundamentals of mammal handling, ID and aging, safe anaesthesia and collection of reliable biometric measurements, as well as practice in attaching spool-and-line devices to small mammals, release or spooled animals and tracking of the spools. Philip has undertaken extensive risk assessments and obtained ethical clearance for this procedure from the Zoological Society of London (Ethics Committee chairman Prof. Bill Holt, clearance number 301-BME700, dated 25/01/16). After completion of the training at his discretion, he will be available for advice and guidance for the duration of this project, including modification of protocol if ethical or technical issues arise.","2016-02-01","2016-07-01",FALSE,FALSE,"",56,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Riparian|"

Roads are a catalyst for forest fragmentation as the presence of a logging road through a forest often leads to the expansion of secondary road networks, increase exploitation of resources and land conversion to agriculture. Despite its significant impact on rainforests, studies are scarce. Studies from temperate regions have shown that the development of roads acts as a barrier to the movement of forest small mammals. Roads lead to the creation of large gaps in the forests, which exposes animals adapted to the dark, damp understorey of the forest to higher temperatures and sunlight penetration; and increases vulnerability to predators. Small mammals like rodents are important components to the function of a tropical forest ecosystem. They help control forest structure and composition through herbivory, seed predation, and pollination. They also act as a major prey source for top predators such as birds and large mammals. Small mammals respond to habitat changes through responses in movement patterns, which also makes them good indicators of habitat disturbance and edge effects in tropical ecosystemsIn conjunction with ongoing logging at SAFE, I aim to examine the impacts of logging road creation on the movement of small mammals. Specifically this study aims to investigate (1) Whether small mammals will cross logging roads encountered within their habitat, (2) The movement patterns on a fine spatial scale of rats in this heterogeneous habitat, and (3): Are these patterns affected by the width of the road and surrounding forest quality?","I will sample small mammals along logging roads of two size and disturbance categories: narrow roads (<5m) in lightly-logged forest, and wide roads (>5m) in heavily-logged forest,. At each site, I will establish a trapping transect at 20m from the edge of the logging road, consisting of a line of 20 points separated by 15m. At each point I will place a pair of “Tomahawk style” traps within a 5m radius, baited with oil palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis). The traps will be deployed for one to two nights, and checked and re-set daily in the late afternoon. To avoid physiological stress to the mammals, these will be set only in well-shaded microhabitats in dense cover, and care will be taken to select sufficiently large and fresh bait to provide adequate nutrition (past studies in this field area show that large oil palm fruit are ample nutrition for all likely-captured species). A trapping grid in continuous forest will be established as a control site to obtain the movement pattern of Maxomys rats in a homogenous habitat.I will translocate and track animals using a spool-and-line device to assess fine spatial scale habitat movements. The method involves attaching a bobbin of fine quilting thread (spool) on an animal with one end attached to the vegetation or a rock at the point of release. The spool then unravels freely from the inside, and catches on vegetation and rocks to record a 3D trace of its movement through the habitat. At the end of the spool, the end freely detaches, allowing the animal to escape.  To attach the spool-and-line device, individuals will firstly be anaesthetized with diethyl ether delivered via a fume container. The animal will then be identified, sexed and aged, and either released or retained for tracking, depending on several criteria. Firstly, treeshrews and squirrels will be released immediately; as well as being partly arboreal, these species are known (from previous small mammal trapping experience in this study area) to be too stress-prone to track. Rare species unlikely to provide sufficient sample sizes will also be released; this study will focus on common and resilient rats of the genus Maxomys.

This ensures representative movement is observed, and meets widely-accepted ethical guidelines for tracking devices. A small part of the fur will be shaved from the back of the neck/ upper back region for the attachment of the spool using a high-viscosity super glue. The spools will be wrapped with a layer of cling-film (which aids detachment), and an outer layer of gaffer tape (which reduces tangling on the vegetation). 
After the spool-and-line device is securely attached on the back of the rats, the rats will then be translocated across the road at dusk to a release point 20m from the edge of the road. .
The following morning, I will return and measure the movement of the rats caught by tracking the thread left caught on habitat features. I will record the length of the total track relative to distance travelled, as well as the the number and length of steps in one direction (1step= a straight section delimited by turns of >20°) and the bearings separating each step. This will allow me to assess path tortuosity, tendency to cross roads when homing, and, by measuring microhabitat variables like canopy cover and forest quality, I can assess how these behavioural traits are affected by environmental variables .

"SAFE-PRJ-132","Vectorial Capacity across an Environmental Gradient","P1011719-150x150.jpg","n.gregory15@imperial.ac.uk","Drivers of environmental change (e.g. climate change, land-use) dramatically impact species persistence and interactions central to mediating the transmission of a range of infectious diseases. Particularly responsive to environmental parameters are mosquito vectors, whose parasites exert enormous fitness and economic costs across the globe. Given that transmission intensity of mosquito-borne parasites is inextricably linked to vector biology, characterizing the response of mosquitoes to these environmental changes is critical for effective disease control. Current models of mosquito-borne disease transmission remain limited by static assumptions of mosquito ecology and environmental parameters, often resulting in over optimistic predictions of disease control effectiveness (Dye & Hasibeder 1986).Temperature directly influences transmission-relevant mosquito traits, including development rate, adult body size and duration of gonotrophic cycle (the period between blood feeding and ovipositing). Controlled laboratory manipulations and descriptions of ambient temperature typically correlate mosquito life-history traits with mean conditions, whereas in reality, mosquitoes experience daily temperature fluctuations. Additionally, the few available studies that consider temperature variation - transmission dynamics relationships have demonstrated greater magnitude of temperature effects on factors influencing vector competence, highlighting the need to further explore these relationships across ecologically realistic thermal regimes.
Using stage-specific, field-based methods, the proposed project seeks to characterize how key parameters of mosquito vectorial capacity vary across an environmental gradient. Specifically, I will use well-established field-based sampling methods to 1) characterize the per-capita impact of natural temperature variation on larval development rate and mortality for Aedes aegypti, a key vector species; 2) characterize the impact of larval temperature regimes on adult traits relevant to vectorial capacity (e.g. adult body size); and 3) establish baseline parameter values for adult survival in the field as a function of larval development rate and temperature regime.","Stage I: Egg collection
A set of infusion-baited oviposit traps will be established near the SAFE field house as source traps. Traps will consist of 10x25x15 cm black containers containing approximately 200ml of Tertafin fish food infusion and lined with paper towels to provide substrate for ovipositing female Aedes mosquitoes. Egg paper will be collected and replaced every 2 days. The number of eggs will be counted, papers dried and then stored in a plastic container under cool conditions until a sufficient number has been obtained (N = 100 per trap).Stage II: Larval rearing tanks
Three rearing tanks, each containing 300mL of Tertafin infusion, will be placed at each second-order sampling point across old growth, logged forest (Fragment B) and oil palm sites (N = 72; see Fig 1.). In each tank, mosquito eggs (N = 100) will be submerged in infusion to allow for embryonation and hatching.
Traps will be monitored daily and the proportion of each developmental stage recorded. Once larvae begin to pupate, a small wooden stick will be placed in each trap to provide a resting substrate for emerging adults. Traps will also be covered with muslin cloth to prevent adults escaping. The level of infusion in each container will be marked with permanent marker (at approximately 5cm) in an effort to standardize nutritional availability across tanks. Whilst previous work has included locally collected stagnant water in the bait solution, site-specific differences in water nutrients may limit our ability to later attribute larval development rates to microclimate alone. Data loggers (EL-USB 2 RoH8, temperature accuracy <±0.5 ◦C) will be placed approximately 10cm below ground at each trap and set to monitor ground temperature at intervals of 3 hours for duration of the sampling period.
Stage III: Adult survival (starvation assays)
When encountered, adult mosquitoes will be removed from traps and transferred to mesh cages, organised by day of emergence, at the field house. Adults will be monitored daily and the proportion of mosquitoes surviving recorded. Dead mosquitoes will be removed and identified to species (if possible). To quantify wing length, one wing will be removed from each adult female and mounted onto glass microscope slide using double-sided tape and cover slips. Wings will be measured using a stereomicroscope. Wing measurements will be taken from the tip of the wing (excluding fringe) to the distal end of the alula.","2016-01-25","2016-04-30",FALSE,FALSE,"",134,"|Ecology|Infectious Diseases|Microclimate|"

This great diversity is massively impacted by anthropogenic land-cover change and habitat alteration for palm oil monoculture (Giam et al. 2015) for which the area of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, supplies one of the greatest exports of palm oil worldwide. Teleost assemblages can act as powerful tools for assessing aquatic environments (Harris, 1995), however little research effort has been invested in the freshwater fishes of Borneo (Closs et al. 2016; Giam et al. 2015). This project will use the experimental landscapes of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project to examine the immediate dietary composition of freshwater fish between a variety of streams with differing levels of land-cover alteration and anthropogenic disturbance. The aim of this study is to investigate the immediate dietary composition of freshwater fish within streams over a land use gradient, with reference to whether there is an ontogenetic shift in diet between conspecifics of different sizes. Key questions are: (1) How does dietary composition vary between conspecifics through differing land use types and (2) How does diet change between conspecifics at different life stages.","Sampling will occur in a minimum of three permanent streams in water catchments that have approximately equal area and slope, typically between 2-3m wide, 2km long and enclosed by forest canopy.

A control catchment will be outside of the experimental zone but match the abiotic features of those sampled within the experimental area. In all catchments sampling transects of 200m in length will be established. Control sites will include Danum Valley Conservation Area and Maliau Basin Conservation Area.Specimens will be collected using 'bottle traps' and cast-netting to live-capture teleosts. Bottle traps are made from recycled 1.5 L plastic water bottles, set every 10m along the 200m transect facing upstream, flush with the stream bed and baited with bread and fish. Traps will be set at each of the experimental sites for 5 consecutive days and monitored every 24 hours. A 9-foot cat net with a ¼ inch mesh size will be employed to capture live fish.

"SAFE-PRJ-137","Investigating the occupancy of otter species in oil palm and forest estates in Sabah, Malaysia","","al480@kent.ac.uk","Three species of otter are reported from Borneo with certainty: Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana), and smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata). All three are listed on the IUCN Red List, with A. cinereus and L. sumatrana categorized as ‘Vulnerable’, and L. perspicillata categorized as ‘Endangered’. Current agricultural intensification in Southeast Asia is noted to be a cause of decline for all populations, but large gaps in our knowledge of Bornean otters make it difficult to assess the threats they face.The extent to which riparian reserves can sustain otter populations in modified landscapes, and what habitat elements are most important to otter persistence within these landscapes is unknown. While factors predicting the occupancy of European and North American otters are well studied, the minimum habitat requirements for Asian otter species are poorly understood. Studies elsewhere show a strong correlation between otter presence and habitat variables including bank vegetation, surrounding land use, and distance to human disturbance. Although the degree of surrounding anthropogenic activity is often negatively correlated with bankside cover and pollution, otters may demonstrate a tolerance to human disturbance if adequate shelter is available (e.g. in Western Ghats, Prakash et al. 2012 Tropical Conservation Science). Riparian reserves could therefore play an important role in maintaining otter presence despite the high degree of anthropogenic activity in oil palm dominated landscapes. Our joint research between UMS and DICE under the LOMBOK consortium will provide much needed baseline data on otter occupancy in Sabah, which can be used in combination with other inventories elsewhere for a state-wide appraisal. Results from this project will help to establish the importance of riparian reserves in oil palm and forestry estates for semi-aquatic fauna.","This project is nested within the NERC-LOMBOK consortium working at SAFE, and will form the basis of MSc research projects at DICE-Kent and UMS. We will examine patterns of otter occupancy and habitat use by sampling a minimum of 18 stream segments across the SAFE landscape and surrounding oil palm estates, using visual signs and camera traps as indicators. Within the SAFE area, the project will have access to the six ‘experimental’ riparian zones, and up to three forested riparian controls (R-LFE, R-VJR and a newly established site at the LF camp). LOMBOK researchers have also identified six established riparian reserves (RR2, RR3, RR7, RR12, RR14, RR16) and three rivers without a riparian zone (R-OP2, R-OP9, R-OP10) outside of the immediate SAFE project area in the surrounding oil palm estates. Each stream will be surveyed on at least two occasions using a 600 m walking visual sign transect conducted at each site. All signs including direct encounters, spraints (faeces), prints, and dens will be recorded. Spraints and prints will be aged (>2 days, < days) in order to prevent repeat sampling.Potential predictors of otter occupancy: Characteristics of streams and shorelines will be recorded at regular intervals along each transect in order to establish potential habitat covariants predicting otter occupancy.

Bank vegetation will be categorized by height, canopy cover, and distance to stream edge.

The Long Tailed Macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is an abundant species of primate in South East Asia and is categorised as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. As a generalist feeder, M. fascicularis are known for their ability to readily adapt to changing environments, particularly human driven change (synanthropy) such as deforestation and urbanisation. With this in mind, I intend to determine how their diet compares across two types of environment, natural and manmade. From this we will know which fall-back foods may be important when M. fasicularis is driven out of its natural environment, and how dramatically a generalist can change what it eats in order to survive.","Study environments will include pristine rainforest at Maliau Basin Conservation Area and Acacia plantation at the SAFE project site.

"SAFE-PRJ-14","The Maliau Quantitative Inventory","soil-safe-110x110.jpg","d.carpenter@nhm.ac.uk","Understanding biodiversity patterns across landscapes is not only intrinsically important but it is also vital for setting conservation priorities. This is because the ability to respond to threats to biodiversity across landscapes requires a comprehensive understanding of the factors that structure communities across landscapes. Of particular importance is an understanding of how fragmentation and disturbance affects biodiversity. The New Forest Quantitative Inventory (NFQI) set up a standardised framework to explore these important patterns of biodiversity across a fragmented and disturbed landscape. It gathered important benchmark data for a number of taxa, including ecosystem engineers (earthworms, ants, soil macrofauna), hyperdiverse groups (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, lichens) and bioindicators (lichens). This Quantitative Inventory approach has now been developed as an ideal way to explore biodiversity across landscapes. We propose to use the Quantitative Inventory approach to explore biodiversity across a landscape in Borneo that is broadly comparable with the New Forest landscape. This will enable the further development of the combined morphology-molecular protocol for sampling biodiversity across landscapes, as initiated in the NFQI, and will facilitate testing of the protocol in a landscape where the taxonomy is far less well known. As importantly, it will also allow us to undertake a rigorous temperate-tropical comparison of landscape level biodiversity between the New Forest and Maliau.","The project design will be modified from the New Forest Quantitative Inventory so as to allow a direct temperate-tropical comparison. The habitat strata, methods and taxa sampled are as follows: Soil, handsorted pits, macrofauna, beetles, ants, termites, earthworms. Litter, transects with Winkler bags, above plus Hymenoptera. Ground Surface, pitfall traps, amcrofauna, beetles, ants Hymenoptera. Dung, dissection, Scarabs, earthworms, termites. Dead Wood, modified termite transect, beeltes, termites, earthworms, NFQI-Bioassess method, lichens. Under trees, Malaise-FITs, Hymenoptera. Tree surface, NFQI-method, lichens. Midcanopy, aerial malaise-FITs, Hymenoptera, beetles ants lichens. We will use the SAFE project site as the landscape for this project. We will have 4 habitat types replicated 10 times giving a total of 40 plots as follows: oil palm (10); open plots (cleared forest; 10); secondary forest (10) and isolated primary forest control (10). Identifying the material that we collect is crucial for our understanding of the factors that structure biodiversity. The sheer diversity and abundance of species presents a challenge. Some taxa are well known and can be identified (termites, ants, lichens, earthworms and other soil macrofauna). Other taxa are not well known and required a combined morphology/barcoding approach (e.g. beetle and Hymenoptera). The current SIF-funded project on Hymenoptera in the New Forest has allowed us to develop a strategy for sampling, sorting, barcoding and identifying hyperdiverse and taxonomically difficult groups, which we will use in this project. Following the NFQI protocol, we will be able to deposit identified (and for many specimens barcoded) material for a number of taxa in the collections. For all studied groups this will considerably enhance the value of the collections.","2012-09-01","2012-10-31",FALSE,TRUE,"Accomodation",35,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|"
"SAFE-PRJ-140","Small mammal competition","","agoldman@hku.hk","It is estimated that less than 50% of the original Indo-Malayan forest is still intact (Asner et al 2005, Sodhi et al. 2004) and there seems to be no slowing down in the destruction (Hansen et al 2013). Sabah alone is more than 85% logged, and the palm oil industry is growing by about 7% every year (Sodhi et al. 2010). With a rate of forest loss this high, the impact on biodiversity is unpredictable. Arthropod species may be particularly susceptible to even a slight change in the environment due to high habitat specificity (Dunn 2004). And it’s not just arthropods. There are many forest species that share relationships in a highly specific way with one or a few other species. With drastic environmental loss, such information can be useful in determining the effects of deforestation on each population of decomposers and dispersers and how their numbers might shift. It is assumed biodiversity will decline while the rate of specific individual species, who are more robust and tolerant of change, will compensate (Larson, et al 2005, Gibson, et al 2011). However, it is rare that the relationships between these similarly functioning species are observed. Previous research of similar, more simple interactions has been studied on desert ecosystems (Brown et al. 1979), but none as complex and biodiverse as a tropical rainforest. By looking at the differences in environmental sensitivity and their population responses, these observations can help gauge future impacts on the global change in biodiversity (Hirota et al. 2011). Aim of work: measure response of small mammals to (1) ant suppression and (2) termite suppression.Type of work: observational surveys (no experiments). Data to be collected: records of each individual small mammal trapped (species, sex, age class, body size and length measurements), mostly used to determine species diversity and abundance. We will also collect hair samples, fecal samples, and ectoparasite samples from trapped animals. Individuals will be marked using ear tags (or possibly PIT tags).","I propose a study of the existing ant and termite suppression plots at the Maliau Basin Conservation Area in Malaysian Borneo. Often referred to as “Sabah’s Lost World”, the MBCA is a bowl of pristine forest considered to be one of the most untouched areas of the world. This fairly self contained ecosystem provides an incredible opportunity to gauge the response of environmental change. My research area will consist of 12 plots, each 50m x 50m with a 15m buffer zone in Malaysian Borneo at the Maliau Basin Conservation Area. I will join the ant and termite suppression team and use their existing locations as my study sites. Over the course of 3-5 months I will observe population and behavioral differences. When the ant survey concludes, I will continue to survey mammals in the same plots, to document any changes in populations once the suppression is removed.Within each of the study sites there will be a control site, an ant- suppressed site and non-ant suppressed site. There, I will attempt to determine small mammal species abundance by recording numbers of individuals and identifying species in each location. I will use these data from each plot to determine the differences in the environmental effects. Termite populations will be controlled by application of Loo Roll baits, soaked in immidacloprid (Jones, et al 2000). The ant populations will be controlled with cat food soaked in immidacloprid along the 15m buffer zones to suppress the populations from outside of the plots and commercially available pesticides (Synergy bait) inside of the plots. These treatments can reduce ant populations as much as 90% in the center of these plots (Klimes et al. 2011). These suppression techniques will be executed by the team at the MBCA and have been in process for 1 year prior to the start of my study. Small mammal populations will be monitored in the paired ant seclusion plots and control sites using live capture methods, previously practiced at SAFE (Cusack et al. 2015). In the one- hectare plots where insect populations are suppressed, the small mammal population will be monitored and recorded using live “Tomahawk” and “Sherman” style cage traps. In the one- hectare plots where the insect populations are not disturbed, the mammals will be re-located using live “Tomahawk” style cage traps and marked with pit tags, effectively reducing their density in the plot. All captured specimens will be released after being weighed, measured, pit-tagged, brushed for ectoparasites and two samples of hair will be removed- one sample the hairs will be plucked from the nape of the neck for stable isotope analysis, which will be consistent with hair samples taken from historic museum specimens and the other will be a clip of fur from the rear right leg to identify that is has been previously captured. Any wounds from trap doors will be disinfected and cleaned before release. The trapping will occur for fourth months every year until 2019 to monitor population changes.","2016-03-22","2016-07-01",FALSE,FALSE,"",NA,"|Zoology|Ecology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-141","Linking leaf venation networks to herbivory","","bblonder@gmail.com","Leaf venation networks show a striking diversity of forms ranging from simple branching patterns (e.g. Gingko) to complex highly reticulate patterns (e.g. Inga). The adaptive drivers of this reticulation have been hypothesized to include damage resistance, damage resiliency, mechanical strength, and water conservation. Non-adaptive drivers such as developmental constraints and low selective costs have also been proposed. However data to assess these questions have been limited. One key hypothesis that has lacked data is the relationship between herbivory rates and leaf veins. More veins may make herbivory more difficult, or may help re-route carbon and water fluxes if damage does occur.As part of the BALI project we are measuring both multiple metrics of leaf venation network reticulation (size, quantity, and shape of loops in the veins). We are also measuring herbivory rates (% area consumed) on the dominant species within several 1ha plots that include several SAFE carbon plots as well as locations in Danum Valley and Maliau Basin. Finally, we are also measuring other defense investments for these species, e.g. secondary compound concentrations, lignification, etc. We will then ask whether increased vein reticulation has a direct negative impact on herbivory rates after correcting for other defensive investments, and whether or not this effect changes systematically across disturbance gradients. This work will provide new descriptive knowledge of the vascular networks of hundreds of Asian species and will address a key untested hypothesis relevant to the ecology and evolution of leaf physiology.","Following the traits campaign protocol in the BALI traits campaign, we will collect leaves from sunlit and shaded branches of the biomass-dominant species along eight 1 hectare forest plots. Other members of the traits campaign will reserve some leaves for analysis of herbivory rates (% leaf area consumed, measured by the ratio of leaf area remaining divided by inferred original leaf area) and for secondary compound production and fiber content (lignins/tannins/phenols/etc.).We will obtain one healthy mature leaf for venation analysis. This leaf will be pressed and dried,. A 1cm2 section of this leaf will then be removed for chemical preparation. This section will avoid any damaged regions and be taken from the midpoint of the left side of the lamina. Using a standard procedure (see Perez Harguindegy’s Austr J Bot (2013) functional trait handbook) we will chemically treat these samples with sodium hydroxide and safranin stain to isolate and stain the veins. Samples will then be slide-mounted and imaged at 2x magnification with a digital camera and compound microscope. Images will then be hand-traced and the thickness of all veins estimated. Using image analysis programs written in MATLAB we will then estimate the distribution of vein loop sizes, shapes (aspect ratios) and nesting (small-radius loops within large-radius loops). We will correlate principal components of these metrics against herbivory metrics to address the original research questions. Approximately 700 leaves will be treated, imaged, and analyzed. As an effort to streamline this analysis process we will also experiment with automated image analysis in collaboration with M Fricker (University of Oxford) and rapid x-ray microCT imaging in collaboration with J Schneider (University of Oxford), potentially also developing methods papers that will outline ways to make venation network analysis more accessible for future investigators.","2015-08-01","2015-12-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",NA,"|Plant Science|Ecology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-142","Isoprene measurements from tropical forests using a new robust instrument – the iDirac","","cgb36@cam.ac.uk","Isoprene emissions from tropical forests in Borneo are currently poorly characterised and misunderstood. As a majority of the globally emitted VOC is isoprene from tropical forests, it is important to understand this emission and how this could change with land-use alteration. Isoprene is an important gas in the atmosphere, its oxidation determines the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and the composition of the air, with implications for health of humans and that of the biosphere. Our newly developed gas chromatography instrument, the iDirac, has the capability for long term measurements in remote areas or for measurement of individual species emission, most of which are undetermined. Its rugged design allows it to run autonomously in the field and withstand the harsh conditions of the rainforest. We hope to determine the emission patterns from various sites in Sabah, comparing and contrasting different degrees of human disturbance as well as investigating the natural emission from the vertical structure of the rainforest.","The iDirac uses a custom built gas chromatography system to analyse ambient air from an inlet. It is currently housed in a 10kg Pelicase and requires a power source, (either a car battery or a solar panel), and a carrier gas source, (either a nitrogen cylinder or ambient air pump). This will be deployed for long unattended sessions at various key sites in the SAFE/Maliau study areas between the old growth forest and the heavily logged sites. These instruments will require little maintenance and should collect valuable data, showing diurnal trends on a larger scale – hopefully revealing the seasonal variability of isoprene emission and even annual patterns. This data could be correlated with meteorological data to see how local weather events affects local isoprene emission. Another aspect of the research is involved in investigating vertical forest structure, which involves access to the forest canopy and making measurements at different heights. This will allow us to describe the emission from the various parts of the forest and even to calculate a flux of isoprene to the atmosphere. Measurement of individual tree species for their isoprene emission involves the use of a chamber around each leaf and will contribute to a database of isoprene emission from different species and will give an idea of emission patterns in the forest, based on species distribution.","2015-10-01","2018-12-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",NA,"|Plant Science|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Microclimate|"
"SAFE-PRJ-143","Demographic responses of understory bird communities to forest fragmentation","","hightower.jn@gmail.com","My proposed research will seek to answer questions regarding how forest fragmentation impacts understory bird communities in a lowland forest of Borneo. South East Asia is undergoing rapid forest loss and fragmentation due to logging and agricultural crop conversion, such as palm oil (Achard et al. 2014). Yet little information is available on how the bird communities respond to forest fragmentation and the mechanisms of this change in SE Asian forests (Powell et al. 2015). I am interested in identifying initial community level responses to fragmentation that may drive the persistence or decline of a species in fragmented forests. The experimental design of the SAFE project and the current stage of the fragmentation make it an ideal environment to investigate early responses of bird communities to fragmentation. I will answer the following questions: 1) How do birds initially respond to fragmentation? Immediately following fragmentation will we see an influx of new individuals in the community due to the surrounding habitat loss (e.g. a ‘crowding effect’) or will birds immediately begin to disappear from the fragments. 2) How does forest fragmentation impact the survival and productivity of understory birds? While estimates of survival are best obtained with long term data, mark-recapture studies may provide insight into the initial demographic responses immediately following fragmentation. 3) How does forest fragmentation impact the body condition of understory birds? Immediately following fragmentation will birds show a significant decrease in body condition? Will body condition vary between fragment residents and immigrants?","Sampling will take place in both 10-hectare and 100-hectare fragments within blocks A, B, C, D, E, and F, as well as VJR and logged forest controls. I will use capture-recapture data to estimate survival and productivity across a range of species, as well as track movement into and out of fragments. I will use standard mist netting techniques to obtain demographic information and morphometric measurements on understory bird species over the next four years. Birds will be captured using mist net arrays with the number of nets standardized across all sampling sites. Sampling will occur in each site twice per year. Mist net lanes will be established and re-used over the course of the study, taking advantage of natural breaks in vegetation and making every effort to reduce the amount of ground vegetation cleared to erect the nets. Mist nets will be opened at sunrise and checked every 30 minutes until 12:00 p.m. for three consecutive days. In the event that nets must be closed (e.g., rain or avian predator nearby) the time will be made up on the fourth day. All captured birds will be quickly removed from the net and placed in cloth bags to reduce stress during transport to a centralized banding station, where they will be quickly processed and released. Each individual will be banded with uniquely numbered aluminum bands and color band combos to allow for identification through both re-sights and recaptures. Following banding, I will measure wing chord, tarsus length, and body mass, as well as check for molt, assess fat deposits and the development of pectoral muscles, and check for breeding condition (brood patch or cloacal protuberance). We will also determine sex and age of all captures to the extent of available information.

This will allow GPS coordinates to be taken from each tree, in addition to sterile plant material for plant identification. Diameter at breast height will be measured prior to felling. The following measurements will be taken from each sampled tree once felled: total height; height of first branch; commercial bole length; and crown width. The diameter of the commercial bole will be at measured at 2 meter intervals along its length. Damage to commercial boles is unlikely to acceptable to the harvesting contractors during the matrix clearance. From the top and bottom of each bole a “cookie” will be therefore taken and weighed to in order to calculate the total mass of the bole extracted. With the collection of the above measurements we will therefore be able to generate new taxonomic-specific height:dbh allometries, and allometric equations for estimation of commercial bole biomasses. The mass of leaves, twigs and branches will be measured using weighing scales, allowing allometries of total tree biomass to be derived.From each 'cookie' two wood cores will be sampled using Suunto increment borers (Suunto, Finland). The wood density of one core from each 'cookie' will be calculated using the methods outlined in Chave (2005), where wood density is calculated as oven dried weight (g) / fresh core volume (cm3) (fresh core volume measured using the water displacement method and oven dry mass reached by drying cores to constant mass at 105°C respectively). Bark will be removed from cores prior to measurement of volume. These cores will subsequently be milled to a homogeneous fine powder and C content analysed using a CN analyser.

Very few studies are able to investigate tree biomass and the constituent parameters (notably height measurements, and measurements of crown biomass) due to the inaccessibility of the forest canopy and the need for extremely costly and time-consuming destructive harvests.

The purpose of the BALI research consortium is to investigate how human modification of tropical forests alters functional biodiversity and the implications that this holds for biogeochemical processes. Research activities will focus on key biotic functional groups, namely trees and lianas, mycorrhizae, free-living soil microbes, and termites and ants. These organisms are the principal agents for biogeochemical cycling in human-modified tropical forests, and quantification of their abundance, functional characteristics and activity will provide insights into the elemental cycles that they catalyse.
The overall aims of the project are to:
(i) Analyse pre-existing data on distributions of key biodiversity groups
(ii) Sample the landscape-scale treatments at the SAFE Project site (forest degradation, fragmentation, oil palm conversion) and key auxiliary sites elsewhere in Malaysia
(iii) Implement new experiments that manipulate key components of biodiversity
(iv) Use process-based models coupled to novel airborne remote sensing methods to upscale plot-level measurements to the region.
This proposal description focuses on (iii): we will perform new manipulative experiments to assess the specific role of focal biodiversity groups (ants and termites) in modulating biogeochemical fluxes (C, N, P, trace gases).","Field measurements and experiments will be conducted in 2 cover types that represent the extremes of an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in Borneo (Figure 3): old growth forest (OG) and oil palm (OP). We will characterise and quantify the underlying functional traits of termites, ants and soil microbes across different land-use types in order to better understand how these taxa influence biogeochemical cycling. Core activities include: soil sampling for physiochemical properties and soil microbial community metrics and quantification of the abundance and functional traits of termites and ants.
Termites will be sampled using standard protocols to measure assemblage structure, abundance and biomass from soil, wood, mounds and nests, while activity will be assessed using cellulose baits (toilet rolls). Ants will be sampled using standardised protocols to quantify assemblage structure in each cover type, including leaf litter extractions (passive Winkler bags) and pitfall traps (surface and belowground). Protein and carbohydrate baits will also be used to conduct very rapid assessments of ant abundance and activity across the plots; sampling that will also prove essential for our experimental manipulations (see below), to determine the efficacy of the chemical exclusion treatments and the timing of repeat chemical applications.We will use a series of manipulative experiments to disentangle the effects of termites and ants on biogeochemical cycling. Biogeochemical fluxes will be quantified by other team members of the wider consortium.
Invertebrate manipulations: To determine the contribution ants and termites make to biogeochemistry, we will establish a series of 1 ha plots in which either termites or ants are suppressed. The temporary suppressions will be achieved using novel toxic bait methods that have been successfully employed in other studies, including recent successful trials conducted by Co-Is Parr and Eggleton in South Africa (unpublished). Although we will not be able to exclude all termites (e.g. baiting of soil-feeding termites will not be possible), we will nevertheless be able to substantially reduce the density of other termite groups that we anticipate will have a significant effect on biogeochemical cycling. Our pilot data indicate that the suppression is temporary and once the treatment is stopped, ants and termites rapidly recolonise the area.
Our focus will be on epigaeic rather than arboreal ant species: suppression of this group alone is anticipated to have substantial ecological effects. Each treatment will be replicated 4 times in old growth and oil palm (24 plots total: 3 treatments (including controls) x 4 replicates x 2 forest types) and run for 2 years. The focus of the measurements in these plots will be in the central 0.25 ha to avoid edge effects. We will monitor the abundance of ants and termites in the suppression plots to determine when repeated chemical application is required.

This investigation aims to characterize and quantify the functional diversity of Sabah's tropical rainforests and the underlying functional traits of trees and lianas across different land-use types. Since tropical rainforests host unique species richness, the effects of land-use changes as well as global change potentially lead not only to a species loss but also to a loss in essential ecosystem functions.

Exposed crowns will be accessed by tree climbing and measures of gas exchange (Amax and Rd) will be made on leaves on branches immediately re-cut under water post-excision and on a sub-sample of common species selected to represent divergent functional types (canopy dominants, lianas, pioneers). Sun and shade leaves will be collected and processed according to the guidelines for a complete analysis of spectranomic and functional traits (spectranomics.stanford.edu). Stem and wood traits will be measured for the same sample of trees and lianas using shoot samples from the canopy (twig and branch traits) and stem cores (for wood traits). Leaf samples will be collected using a pole-pruner, slingshot or canopy access and returned the same day to the SAFE or Maliau Basin laboratories for physio-chemical processing.","2015-02-01","2015-12-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",8,"|Plant Science|Ecology|Soil Science|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Biogeochemistry|"

This is especially relevant in the highly diverse freshwater systems of Malaysia, where large scale land conversion to oil palm production threatens freshwater communities through mechanisms such as soil erosion, removal of riparian vegetation, the use of agro-chemicals and detrital input alterations. These factors can profoundly affect community dynamics both directly, through pollution driven species loss, and indirectly through the modification of trophic pathways. Despite current threats, freshwater community responses to habitat conversion remain poorly characterised and understudied.Aquatic invertebrates dominate freshwater systems in terms of diversity and functional importance, however predation by fish can represent one of the major driving forces of macroinvertebrate community structure. The current study attempts to examine how predator-prey relationships are modified through a gradient of habitat conversion, using a metagenomic framework to identify the diversity of macroinvertebrate prey utilised by fish predators.Some key questions include: How taxonomically diverse are focal species' diets? And do they reflect classical ideas of vertical niche separation in freshwater fish? How does dietary composition change through different land use types? And what is the taxonomic turnover of this change?","Transects (200m) from existing SAFE project data collection will be used in order to preserve the integrity of population level data. Fish will be sampled using bottle trapping and cast netting along all transects. Dietary samples will be collected by non lethal gastric lavage, whereby fish are held ventral surface up over a collection bowl and a catheter is placed in the mouth of the fish, using short pulses of water to flush out stomach contents. Stomach contents will then be preserved in ethanol.A reference database of potential prey species will be constructed using a Surber sampler to collect macroinvertebrate species, reference specimens will be identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and imaged. Following imaging, next generation sequencing technologies will be used to obtain complete mitochondrial genomes from all reference specimens. DNA from stomach samples will then be extracted and sequenced, and sequence data searched against the reference dataset of mitochondrial genomes for species matches.","2014-03-31","2014-05-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",50,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Freshwater Biology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-21","Composition and abundance of tropical freshwater vertebrate communities across a land use gradient","OPCHNLG2anylSRlDy-IkltfLNQpWVNPzqCDdrMpff9w-150x150.jpg","clare.wilkinson12@imperial.ac.uk","Freshwater systems are extremely diverse and provide fundamental services for humans. They are part of the most threatened habitats globally due to agricultural expansion. In Malaysia oil palm production poses the most significant threat to freshwater systems as it pollutes waterways, changes allochthonous inputs and alters flow. Species and community changes after habitat conversion remain poorly documented in freshwater tropical regions.Freshwater vertebrates (for example: fish and terrapins), play an important role in controlling the 'in stream' food web, species interactions and competitions. However, there is a paucity of information on the ability of freshwater fish to adapt to the environmental impacts of deforestation, habitat conversion and climate change, although, Martin-Smith (1997) suggested mesohabitats are more important in determining fish community structure than forest logging history. More information is therefore required on fish diversity, composition and abundance as they are a key part of the aquatic food web, and may demonstrate perturbations to the system. In Malaysia there is a specific need to research the impacts of oil palm agriculture and logging on freshwater systems, due to the extent of planned primary rainforest conversion for oil palm concessions.The aim of this study is to investigate the composition and abundance of freshwater vertebrates across a land use gradient. Key questions: 1. How does relative abundance of freshwater vertebrates vary temporally and spatially, both within and among the different land use types at the SAFE Project? 2. Can Mark-Recapture (pit tagging fish) be used to obtain population estimates of freshwater vertebrates? 3. How do freshwater vertebrate species vary in their movement and dispersal rates ? 4. How do those dispersal rates translate into distance-dissimilarity gradients in community composition?","Expanding upon earlier work on fish community composition at the SAFE Project, the study will repeat the sampling methods used previously to calculate relative species abundance. We will use 'bottle-traps' that will be baited with bread or meat, to attract different species. Traps will be set every 10m along a 200m section of the project streams that encompass the land use gradient.Several methods will be employed to estimate species abundance using Mark Recapture. The aim will be to tag as many as species as possible, but a limited time frame may limit the number of species tagged. Vertebrates caught in the bottle traps, through cast netting in every 'pool', or from baited terrapin traps along the 200m length of each stream will be tagged according to the pilot protocol.A pilot study will be conducted at a single site to determine the necessary number of days needed to recapture enough individuals to obtain a statistically rigorous population estimate at each site. This will ultimately determine the number of streams that can be included in the analysis and the number of species that are tagged. Prior to 'tagging' any fish, a dissection of each species will be conducted, to determine the most appropriate size of pit tag (6mm or 12mm) and the positioning of tags in relation to gastro-intestinal organs and muscle wall thickness. All fish will be anaesthetised using clove oil prior to handling and euthanised via cerebral massage to enable the procedure. Subsequently, all fish for Mark-Recapture will be anaesthetised, fork length measured, tagged and allowed to recover, monitored for any adverse effects, in a separate holding tank before being returned to the stream. Terrapins will be tagged using unique identification numbers glued onto the ventral side of the carapace to avoid any increased predation risk.
We will determine the spatial extent and average movement rates of tagged individuals, focussing our effort on the Virgin Jungle Reserve stream. This stream will have been sampled and contain tagged individuals from the mark-recapture study, but we will add additional, monthly re-sampling of this stream, including upstream and downstream reaches. Pit tagged individuals recaptured will have GPS location recorded to calculate the distances moved.
Statistical analysis: 1. Standard Mark-Recapture models will be used to estimate population size of each tagged freshwater vertebrate species. 2. This will be compared to relative abundances determined from bottle trap sampling in order to determine the most cost effective sampling techniques. 3. Species accumulation and rarefaction curves will also be used to determine species richness at each of the sample sites. 4. GIS mapping will be used to calculate the spatial movement rates of tagged individuals. 5. Community composition will be compared spatially, among aquatic communities in the different land uses, and temporally, examining changes in community composition through time within each land use type.","2013-04-12","2018-01-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",91,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Freshwater Biology|"

Increasingly, anthropogenic alterations have resulted in environments dominated by secondary forests, agricultural mosaics and other human-modified habitats, leading to concerns that ecosystem functions are being eroded and greenhouse gas emissions elevated. The long-term persistence of biodiversity, and the important biogeochemical cycles it underpins, are thus dependent on the manner in which the wider tropical landscape is managed.
Several policies have been developed to mitigate environmental impacts of rainforest exploitation and agricultural expansion. National legislation of tropical countries, and the biodiversity provisions of commodity certification schemes, typically favour preserving remnants of forest and riparian vegetation as conservation set-asides within production estates. In addition, the high-profile United Nations REDD+ programme aims to enhance forest carbon stocks via payments for ecosystem services. One key assumption of REDD+ is that forest protection/restoration to enhance carbon stocks will also benefit biodiversity. However, to date, studies testing the effectiveness of such policies have been reliant on relatively coarse-grain data.
We will test the co-benefit assumptions of REDD+, and examine the outcomes of other policies, by delineating biodiversity and carbon provisions at fine-scale over the SAFE landscape. The work is part of NERC's Human Modified Tropical Forests programme with partners in Malaysia, UK and Brazil. Spatial data we acquire with the network and wider SAFE community will be used to determine whether degraded areas significant for carbon and other biogeochemical ecosystem functions, are also important for species of conservation concern.
As part of this exercise we will augment the SAFE vertebrate diversity dataset for mammals and birds, targeting under-sampled parts of the landscape. Our main focus will be on sampling riparian (various widths) and oil palm sites, as well as fragments using rapid sampling technologies.","VERTEBRATE SURVEYS:
To directly match vertebrate data to the functional data arising from our consortium, surveys will include 30 experimental plots matching 2nd order points across the modification gradient. Plots will encompass logged forest, riparian forest buffers, fragments, mature oil palm, and newly established oil palm. We will also extend sampling to the six experimental watersheds to establish presence/diversity of vertebrates in riparian vegetation corridors of various widths. Three technologies will be used to generate data on species presence at each site:(i) Acoustic recorders will be used to survey bats and birds, using the Songmeter platform (Wildlife Acoustics), scheduled to sample low (i.e. bird) and high (i.e. bat) frequencies. Recording stations will be established in plots, with up to six units operating at any one time for up to six consecutive days. Quantification of presence and activity of species of conservation concern, as well as crude richness estimates based on phonic types, will be automated by training software to recognise bat and bird taxa from freely available databases. Data will be verified against the SAFE dataset by DE and MJS at a subset of sites.(ii) Camera traps will sample terrestrial mammals using the random placement design established previously at SAFE (Wearn & Ewers). We will use Reconyx units, deploying up to 45 cameras at any one time across multiple plots. The spatial configuration of cameras allows for estimates of occupancy and density for some species using Bayesian and/or random encounter modelling.
(iii) Leech-based mammal surveys will complement camera trapping to survey key terrestrial
mammal groups by sequencing the DNA contained within leeches' blood-meals. Exploiting new advances in genetics, we aim to use available mammal genome data to design primers for PCR, multiplexing 100s of overlapping markers in a high precision PCR-based assay. Our set of markers should resolve to genus- or species-level across six major mammal groups, which cover most of Sabah's terrestrial mammals.
DISTRIBUTION & SPATIAL CONGRUENCE
Species-locality data, combined from ongoing SAFE datasets and our field surveys, will be used to model species distributions. This will provide useful upper estimates of vertebrate species richness across the modified landscape. The approach will be linked to Borneo-wide analyses already undertaken (MJS). Vegetation indices will be derived from LiDAR or post-clearance SPOT imagery. Mapping of ecosystem functions will be undertaken with consortium partners. We will assess correlation between spatial layers, and apply regression-based modelling for plot-based data.
POLICY OPTIMISATION
In order to evaluate the policy outcomes for both biodiversity and ecosystem functions we will develop high-resolution coupled ecological-economic models under several management scenarios. The scenarios will be determined in consultation with a stakeholder network in the oil palm and timber sectors. Trade-off analyses will be undertaken using a combination of non-linear programming and regression techniques.","2014-04-01","2018-03-31",TRUE,TRUE,"",54,"|Biodiversity|Policy|"
"SAFE-PRJ-23","Deadwood dynamics","","ect23@cam.ac.uk","Tropical forests play globally important roles in carbon cycles, but few have been studied in detail. Monitoring of forest plots is revealing a pervasive influence of climate change on the carbon dynamics of tropical forest trees. However, the impact of this on logged and degraded forests have seldom been studied, despite these now being the dominant semi-natural forest type in large regions of the tropics. Given the future importance of degraded forests for the provision of ecosystem services and the maintenance of biodiversity, the need to quantify carbon dynamics in these ecosystems is paramount. In this study we will investigate the impact of habitat change on the above ground deadwood and leaf litter and measure how these stocks change over time. This survey also provides a baseline against which the impact of experimental fragmentation can be measured. In particular we will test the following hypotheses: (i) Forest degradation increases the amount of deadwood and leaf litter within a system; (ii) degraded forests show a higher level of tree mortality but a slower rate of decomposition relative to pristine forests; (iii) these changes are related in part to changes in the species composition between habitat types; (iv) the causes of tree mortality differ between pristine and degraded forests; (v) clearance and fragmentation will result in an increase in tree mortality and deadwood within the plots in the short-term.","During the first two years of the project, we established a network of 193 individual 25 by 25 metres planar vegetation plots (see above ground carbon stock methods), centred on the 2ndorder fractal sampling points. Where appropriate, methods followed established RAINFOR protocols (www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/projects/rainfor/). All pieces of deadwood over 10cm diameter in the plots were located and their diameter at each end and length (to the edge of the plot) recorded. The decomposition status of each piece as well as its mode of death (see RAINFOR protocols for more details) was also noted, as was the bearing in which the tree had fallen. Similar data for any standing deadwood was also collected, with the diameter at 1.3m height as well as the estimated apex diameter recorded for trees over 1.3m height, and the height at the apex only, for any trees under 1.3m height. At the same time, a 0.5m2 area of leaf litter was also collected from the ground at the centre of the vegetation plot. This was dried to a constant weight at 50oC, divided into different component parts and weighed (using similar methods to those for the fine litter dynamics project). Various other parameters in the plot were also recorded (see also above ground carbon stocks project, and nutrient cycling patterns in modified forests project), including canopy openness at the centre of each plot (using a spherical densiometer), overall forest quality (using a standard five-point scale), percentage occurrence in the plot of different vegetation types, and the presence of roads and streams. Plots will be re-measured approximately every year to assess the change in deadwood and standing litter over time.

"SAFE-PRJ-24","Land use effect on earthworms","images-150x150.jpg","sri.ven.rao@gmail.com","The tropical rainforest of Borneo is a megadiverse region that is fast disappearing due to logging and intensive agriculture that have caused significant changes to species diversity and composition across the modification gradient. Many taxa that make up the natural ecosystem are being lost due to this process while their natural patterns and ecological significance is little understood. One of such taxa is the earthworm which remains to be understudied in Borneo when compared to other tropical areas.
Studies have shown that despite patchy distribution and low densities in the tropics, earthworms occur in high diversity and represent an important biomass of the food web in soil while playing vital role as soil engineers in soil ecosystem influencing soil processes (Fragoso&Lavelle,1987,1992,1995). Moreover, earthworms are also sensitive to land-use changes as communities can be modified both at functional and taxonomic level over different land conversion (Fragoso et al.1993,1995; Lavelle et al.1994).
Of particular interest is the response of earthworm functional/ecological groups: epigeic, anecic and endogeic (Bouche 1977,Lavelle 1981). These major ecological groups have different effects on soils and their variable ecologies suggest that their responses to disturbance may differ greatly and can alter biogeochemical processes (Lavelle,1983;Blanchart et al.1997).
Hence, this project will study the effect of different land use on the earthworm functional groups. Land use and land cover characteristics will be observed for factors influencing earthworm modification across different land use. Earthworm response and the resulting impact on the soil properties will also be investigated. This study could provide some insight in terms of potential ecological impact of the 'attention lacking' earthworms at each of the different land use sampled at SAFE project site.","A minimum of five sampling point will be laid at SAFE 2nd order sampling sites in old growth forest,secondary forest and oil palm control sites.Consistency in underlying geology soil type and pH across all sampling point will be considered to serve the objective of the study to capture any changes in earthworms due to different land use.Sampling protocol for assessment of earthworm abundance and functional diversity in tropical ecosystems recommended by Bignell et al(2008) following TSBF protocol (Anderson&Ingram,1993) will be employed.
A metal quadrant (25x25cm) will be used to mark the exact position of the monolith at each sampling point and litter from within will be removed and hand sorted One small monolith (25x25x30cm) will be isolated by digging a trench (25cm wide, 30cm depth) outside and around the quadrat. Earthworms excavated from the trench will be collected and the abundance and biomass will be calculated on the basis of 0.50m2 (width of the monolith plus two trench widths squared). Monolith will be stratified into three layers: 0-10cm,10-20cm,20-30cm and hand sorted separately on site. Alternatively each unsorted soil layer will be bagged and kept out of direct sunlight and sorted within hours or sooner.
In addition, three large monoliths of 50x50x30cm will be dug out at 5m intervals along a transect from the smaller monolith (transect will be laid perpendicular to any slope present). Each larger monolith will be separated into layers similar to the small monolith. This stratified sampling scheme combining smaller and larger monoliths will allow for plot level variation in populations to be taken into account.
Hand sorted earthworms (including sliced body parts) will be stored in 6% formalin solution to reduce exudation of mucus removed to lab counted and weighed as preserved specimen after light blotting. Sliced parts with the heads attached will be counted as one individual whereas total body parts excavated will be weighed together as biomass per monolith (Clapperton et al.2007). Earthworm abundance is estimated as the number of individuals per m2 and biomass as g of individuals per m2.
Identification will be done to most specific taxonomic level functional groups (based on feeding habits and distribution in soil profile) and life stage with assistance from Dr Samuel James and Dr Somsak Panh. Statistical analyses will be carried out on dataset to test for significant difference and relationship between earthworms across different land use and soil properties.
Land use characteristics at sampling point such as litter depth canopy and vegetation characteristics will be recorded Soil properties such as pH temperature moisture humus depth texture respiration rate infiltration rate and porosity will be observed and analysed on site Other properties such as soil salinity bulk density and soil organic matter test will be conducted in lab on soil samples taken immediately adjacent to each monolith outer trench wall.","2013-06-01","2013-08-03",TRUE,TRUE,"Laboratory",72,"|Zoology|Ecology|Soil Science|"
"SAFE-PRJ-25","Ecosystem quality and herbivore dynamics in tropical rainforests fragmented by deforestation","2012-09-12-10.34.19-150x150.jpg","S.Maunsell@griffith.edu.au","Herbivory is a key ecosystem process that links plant productivity on the one hand with animal dynamics on the other. In tropical ecosystems, by far the most significant herbivores are insects. As environmental impacts intensify, the range of habitats and roles available for herbivores is likely to change. Some of the resources available within intact primary forests are no longer available in logged-over forests: this diminution in ecological opportunity is expected to accelerate as fragmentation occurs and, presumably, is most extreme in newly created oil palm plantations. Changes in herbivore assemblages may lead to cascading effects upon arthropod predators and plants.
We will examine how communities of herbivorous and predatory arthropods respond to forest modification and fragmentation. With respect to the herbivores, we will assess the bottom-up impacts of changes in the underlying vegetation resource itself (as reflected by the set of functional groups of plants available), and top down effects of natural enemies (with a focus on ants and spiders). More specialized groups of herbivores may be more vulnerable to habitat degradation and fragmentation. We will therefore focus on the Lepidoptera and the Orthoptera which vary in their degree of host specialization in the order of leaf miners>semi-concealed caterpillars>externally feeding caterpillars>Orthoptera (1). Similarly, the response of their predators is likely to vary among different guilds.
This project aims to address the following questions.
1. How does forest conversion and fragmentation affect the community and guild structure of herbivorous insects and their predators?
2. Do herbivore and predator communities change in a fashion that mirrors changes in the community structure and available functional groups of and of host plants or prey?","We will sample herbivorous insects before and after fragmentation, as well as at control sites comprising old growth forest, logged forest and mature oil palm plantations. Complete collections will be made on two occasions: the first in 2014 and the second in 2015. Pennsylvania-style light traps will be used to sample Lepidoptera. Spiders, ants and Orthroptera will be obtained from samples already obtained as part of complementary SAFE projects (modified flight intercept traps (FITs) and vegetation fogging samples). Light traps will be set at eight points within each of five experimental plots that have not yet been cleared so as to obtain pre and post fragmentation samples. Sampling will be carried out at locations that are planned to remain as different sized fragments (100ha, 10ha, and 1ha) and within what will be established as oil palm plantation (two '2nd order points' within each fragment size within each experimental plot). We will also sample at twelve points within each of the control sites. These sites will be those already used for 'pre-treatment' fogging sampling by Dr Yusuh. On each sampling occasion, light traps will be set for three-night period, after which time they will be moved to another sampling point.
Arthropod samples will be sorted and after taxonomic assignment they will be grouped into guilds based on predicted feeding habits and size classes. Arthropod species and guild composition and diversity will be compared across the gradient of forest modification. We will assess changes in the abundance and proportion of individual arthropod guilds to determine which particular arthropod guilds are more susceptible to habitat change, and how this relates to changes in the abundance and proportion of particular plant functional groups. Vegetation data that is being obtained as part of the wider SAFE project will be used for this purpose. We will also use a series of null models of community assembly to investigate whether there is a more even distribution of arthropod individuals among guilds than would be expected at random and whether this changes with forest disturbance. The degree to which herbivore community responses can be predicted from tree community characteristics will be tested across the modification gradient. Deviations from predictions will reveal the degree to which herbivore community responses are contingent on those of the tree community. We predict that such deviations will be greater for less specialized groups of herbivores.
Additional PhD projects (conducted by two to three students who will provide separate proposals to the SAFE Science Advisory Committee) will be linked to the current project and will examine trophic interactions among herbivores and their predators. These will investigate if forest conversion and fragmentation affects the host plant and prey range of herbivorous and predatory arthropods and will involve hand-collecting of spiders and lepidopteran larvae. Larvae will be reared through as a means of estimating rates of parasitoidism and host plant specificity. Gut content analyses of large predatory spiders will be conducted using molecular techniques in order to measure prey.

Land conversion from forest to plantation, particularly of oil palm, is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss in these areas. This has challenged ecologists to add empirical evidence to improve the environmental responsibility and the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity.
This project is part of the SAFE project research on vegetation dynamics and carbon cycling. Its objectives are to determine effects of fragmentation on: (1) the temporal dynamics of litterfall; (2) on decomposition rate; (3) on coarse woody debris stocks; and (4) on seedling mortality, growth, recruitment and species diversity.","The methods of the litterfall dynamics and decomposition experiment follow the SAFE Project manual prepared by Edgar Turner (http://www.safeproject.net/projects). The litterfall dynamics and decomposition experiment will be applied to all vegetation plots across the study area (n=193). The litter will be collected every six months. Litter decomposition measurements will be taken across all sites before logging start in the experimental area, and after logging has finished and approximately at every six months over the course of the study.
The CN ratio of the litter is fundamental to the litter quality database. These are important for comparative study within the same regions. Approximate of 40-60 samples of homogenised leaf-litter from different habitat of fragments (A-F), old growth (OG&VJR), logged forest (LF&LFE) and oil palm (OP) will be analysed to know the CN ratio. The litter from different sites (10-15 replicate per block) will be pooled to estimate the pattern of litter quality among the different block.
Plot-based inventories of the SAFE vegetation plot (n=193) will be used to quantify the stocks of coarse woody debris (CWD). The deadwood dynamics of SAFE project protocol at http://www.safeproject.net/projects will be used to quantify the coarse wood debris in vegetation plots across the SAFE Project area. Plots will be re-measured approximately every year to assess the change in deadwood and standing litter over time.
The seedling assessment will be quantified by establishing a plot-based measurement in the second order of SAFE Project sampling (i.e. the vegetation plots). The plots of 5m x 5m and subplot of 2m x 2m will be established and located at the centre of subplot A in the SAFE vegetation plots. The plots were chosen based on different forest structure refers to blocks categories and classified based on the forest quality range (Ewers et al. 2011). Three blocks comprising six different sites with a total of 84 vegetation plots will be selected across the project area. The plot sampling distribution are: (1) the Fragmented Experiment block - four sites chosen are A, C, D and E with 48 plots (the plots in the 1 ha, 10 ha and 100 ha); (2) the Old Growth block- two sites chosen are OG1 and OG2 with 18 plots; and (3) the Logged Forest- two sites chosen are LF1 and LF2 with 18 plots.
The plots sampling establishment will follow the RAINFOR field manual (http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/projects/rainfor/pages/manuals_eng.html). The corner of the plots will be marked with PVC pipe and painted. Plastic rope will be set around the plots to prevent disturbance by people. The plots will be classified into primary road, skid trail and forested area. Canopy cover within the plots will be assessed visually. The canopy cover categorized into gap and closed. Percent coverage in the 5m2 plot will be assessed visually by using the modified Braun-Blanquet scales. The coverage will classified into tree, climber, ginger, fern, grass, palm and shrub and bare soil.
All plants seedling and lianas above 10cm heights will be measured for height, diameter, X and Y coordinates, tag and identified. The seedlings stem will be assessed and categorised into normal, broken shoot, slanting and climbing. Leaf samples will be collected to help with plant identification (up to species level as possible).
In the 2m2 subplot, all woody seedling and lianas between 10cm and 50cm heights will be measured according to 2 measurements: (1) seedling 10cm and 25cm heights - will be tagged and identified; (2) seedling above 25cm and 50cm height - will be measured for height, diameter, tagged and identified. The diameter point of measurement (POM) is at 20cm height from the ground by taking two diameters readings at 90o to one another using the digital caliper. The POM will be marked for future monitoring. In the 5m2 plot, all seedlings and saplings above 50cm height and less 1cm diameter at 1.3m height will be measured on diameter, tagged and identified. The seedlings monitoring will be conducted approximately at every six-months.
The light density and canopy covers will be measured at the centre of the plot at 1.3m and 1m from the ground, respectively.

In particular we will test the following hypotheses: (i) Forest degradation increases the level of leaf litter fall; (ii) degraded forests show a slower rate of litter decomposition relative to pristine habitats; (iii) the composition and characteristics of litter vary with habitat degradation; (iv) the rate of decomposition is impacted by the identity of leaf litter.","Litter fall was measured in the centre of each of the network of 193 vegetation plots (see above ground carbon stock methods), using a litter collection trap of 1m2, set 1m from the ground. These traps were cleared of any fallen litter and left to collect new litter over approximately a 15 day period, with sampling being repeated every six months. Collected samples were weighed, and all whole leaves photographed on a white sheet. Samples were then oven dried to a constant weight at 50oC. Once dry, samples are separated into (1) leaves, (2) woody material, (3) fruits, (4) flowers, (5) seeds, and (6) unidentified material and each weighed separately. For oil palm samples, separate categories including grass, palm leaves, and palm nuts are also included. Wood over 2cm diameter and any single object making up a high proportion of the weight was weighed separately. Collected leaves were used as the substrate to assess the rate of decomposition across habitats. Collected and dried leaves were pooled for each fragment (A-F) or each area in control habitats (OG1, OG2 etc..) and cut into approx 2cm2 pieces. To allow for future analysis of nutrients, approximately 20% of each leaf was not taken but left in storage. In oil palm habitats, dried material from a cut mature oil palm frond (randomly selected from each site) was used instead, as very little leaf litter was collected in the traps, and most litter in the plantations originates from fronds that have been cut during the harvesting process. Four gram leaf samples were placed into 10cm2 mesh bags of 2-3mm diameter and each plot allocated 2-4 (depending on availability) bags at random containing leaves from their fragment or area. Five standard cotton squares (100% cotton) of 10 by 10cm were also made for each site, weighed and given an individual label. Sets of five cotton squares and 2-4 litter bags were placed among the leaf litter in the centre of each vegetation plot and tethered with twine to aid future location. One litter bag and cotton square were then collected approximately every 20 days from each plot for up to 100 days. After collection, samples were dried to a constant weight at 50oC, brushed clean of dirt, and weighed. Samples were stored for future nutrient analysis. By using a mixture of leaf litter bags and cotton squares to measure decomposition, we will be able to compare the rate of decomposition which reflects that present in the plots (litter bags) to a standard that is independent of leaf litter quality and species composition (cotton squares).

Functional diversity can be calculated and the processes of community assembly can be investigated. Both these aspects of communities will have an influence on ecosystem functions. Here, patterns of functional diversity and community assembly processes will be explored across a tropical forest disturbance gradient in Sabah, Malaysia for a dominant group of terrestrial insects, the ants, in order to characterise and understand the changes that may be occurring due to conversion of forest to agriculture.1) Does functional diversity change with disturbance?
2) Do the dominant patterns of community assembly change with disturbance?
3) What complexes of functional traits, if any, are related to observed changes?","Ant samples taken from 2010 (Luke et al 2010) will be identified to species level and a range of functional morphological traits will be collected from them to calculate functional diversity. Changes in functional diversity patterns and the assembly processes that ultimately characterise them will be investigated through the calculation of three orthogonal metrics: FRic, FEve and FDiv (Villeger et al 2008).

"SAFE-PRJ-3","Impacts of forest modification on bats II - bat diversity and activity in tropical riparian","IMGP5250-150x150.jpg","m.j.struebig@kent.ac.uk","The rationale of this proposal was outlined in my main project, “Impacts of forest modification on bats”, which began in 2011. Here I clarify the proposed methodology and requirements for bat research at riparian margins. Riparian areas may serve as critical landscape elements for promoting diversity over modified landscapes, particularly for bats. Watercourses serve as visual cues by which bats (and other wildlife) can navigate and orientate themselves over the wider landscape; they fulfil an important source of water and aquatic insect prey; and surrounding vegetation may serve as roosting and foraging habitat. Elsewhere in the world riparian areas have been shown to be vital in supporting bat populations, yet there is very little data from the tropics.The extent to which bats use riparian corridors set-aside at the SAFE project will be investigated using a combination of capture and acoustic sampling. Specifically I will test whether rivers with greater corridors widths support more bat species and promote greater bat activity.","Bat surveys will be undertaken along the six 2km experimental riparian corridors and at control catchments in logged forest. Part of the sampling will coincide with the first 200m section of each stream above datalogger stations, so that data coincide with almost all of the other riparian samples that are being collected by SAFE researchers. Because sampling methods are all prone to capture bias, three methods are required to reliably sample bats. 1.Harp traps target insectivorous forest-specialist species, and will be set across transects that act as fly-ways for bats (traps are ineffective if set outside of fly-ways). Unlike the main SAFE sampling sites, the riparian areas do not have access trails that can be used for trapping. Therefore I propose to cut a series of transects in the vegetation corridor of each experimental river catchment. The following design is proposed, which serves to generate enough bat captures for assemblage analyses while also minimizing disturbance on vegetation and other research projects: five 400m long transects (1.5-2.0 m width) staggered either side of the river will be established. Where possible these will follow existing logging skids and trails, but it is very likely that the majority will need to be cut. I propose to sample the transects every 2 years. Vegetation would typically regenerate after 3 months, or alternatively, the transects could be kept open for use by other SAFE researchers. Care will be taken to avoid disturbing other research plots. Where there is no vegetation corridor (i.e. width = 0), mist nets will be set either side of the traps to 'funnel' bats into traps. 2. Mist-nets (70 denier nylon, three or four shelves, 36 mm mesh size) will be set across the watercourse at sampling points along the rivers to target edge-foraging insectivorous bats and fruit bats that are typically underrepresented in traps. Forest-specialist bats cannot be reliably sampled by this technique as many species can detect and avoid nets. 3. Acoustic monitoring will be used to further sample echolocating bats that can avoid harp traps and/or fly above the forest understorey. Ultrasonic bat detectors (SM2 Mono 384kHz) will be used to record bats passively at five point locations per riparian corridor, and species will be identified from their echolocation calls (the bulk of which are available from the literature). Bat activity (number of bat passes; number of bat feeding buzzes) can also be estimated by this technique. A schematic outlining this sampling design is available on request.

"SAFE-PRJ-30","How do changes in species interaction networks affect ecosystem function when tropical forests are degraded?","600px-Macro_Termite_Soldier-110x110.jpg","jtschranka@gmail.com","Although the effects of habitat modification on animal and plant communities are relatively well-known, the manner in which these changes impact species interactions has not been well-quantified, and the links between interaction networks and ecosystem functioning are very poorly known. The ants and termites are called “ecosystem engineers”, for their ability to significantly alter ecosystem functions and processes. After logging, deforestation leading to forest fragmentation and conversion of forest to oil-palm plantation in the SE Asian region, we expect there to be changes in soil dwelling ant - termite foodwebs and interactions, changes in soil processes and changes in niche availability.
Our study aims to investigate how ant and termite relationships, biodiversity, bioturbation, mound-nutrient spectrum and vulnerability to extinction vary along this ecosystem degradation gradient.
We propose these hypotheses:A) Habitat change drives shifts in the communities of soil-dwelling ants and termites
B) Habitat change affects within-trophic group interaction networks.
C) Habitat change affects between-trophic group interaction networks.
D) Habitat change alters the impacts of ants and termites on soil properties
E) Habitat change alters the vulnerability of ecosystem processes to species extinctions
F) Bioturbation rates of the ants and termites are altered by habitat changes
This will be the first time that the relationships between these two groups have been quantified in relation to a gradient of habitat disturbance. Quantifying the stability of tropical forest ecosystems in the face of two major global threats to biodiversity (logging and expansion of oil palm plantation) will be of use to conservation practitioners. This work also has the potential to identify keystone taxa for maintenance of soil quality and so generate candidate species to encourage for optimisation of yields in agro-ecosystems and maintenance of ecosystem functioning in degraded natural systems.","Over the entire habitat modification gradient, we will make collections of ants and termites from 177 second order sampling points (27 primary controls, 27 logged forest controls, 27 oil palm controls, 24 in total in each of the three fragment sizes, plus 24 in areas that are being converted into plantation), and conduct nutrient redistribution assays two out of the three first order points that make up a triangular triplet. At each sampling point, within a single 4m by 4m quadrat, sixteen soil pits (12cm x 12cm x 10cm) will be excavated, and soil searched by hand for ants and termites for 10 person minutes per pit. Dead wood with diameter >5cm within the quadrat will also be broken up and searched. All specimens will be collected into 95% ethanol and kept frozen. Two thirds of these samples have already been collected from pre-fragmentation locations, and the priority for the first field season will be collecting ants and termites from the remaining sites before fragmentation occurs. In following years, after experimental fragmentation, we will repeat the collections across all sites, thus allowing us to assess changes in ant-termite communities and interactions as a result of habitat fragmentation. We will use a series of univariate and multivariate statistical methods to assess changes in ant and termite communities separately, as a result of habitat modification. We will then use environmentally constrained null models of species co-occurrence to quantify within-trophic level interaction networks. To create ant-termite food webs we will use molecular methods to detect termite DNA in ant guts. Impacts of habitat conversion and fragmentation will be assessed by calculating a number of food-web metrics (generality, vulnerability, connectance, number of modules, modularity, and nestedness). These metrics will then be used as response variables within the same univariate analytical framework outlined above. We will use correlations between ant/termite community composition and soil properties to generate a candidate set of species that are likely to be influencing soil properties. Specifically, total Carbon, total Nitrogen, NO3 and NH4 content, total and available Phosphorus and available Potassium content, bulk density, infiltration rate, soil texture and soil taxonomy will be measured at each ant/termite sampling site. We will assess bioturbation rates and shape of underground ant nest structure by using method by Tschinkel (2005), in combination with collecting complete aboveground excavated soil from different anthills to estimate the excavation rates. For our set of candidate species, we will conduct removal experiments, in which single colonies of ants and termites are poisoned, and the relaxation of soil properties following this removal will be measured. We will collaborate with the ongoing NERC consortium, in particular with Dr Kate Parr and Dr Paul Eggleton, who will be conducting plot-based removals of ants and termites.

Butterflies are sensitive with the changing of their surrounding where these characters make butterflies among the suitable groups for studying insect biodiversity and conservation. Our natural habitats nowadays exist as fragmented areas due to human activity such as agricultural. In this research, fragmentation will be studied by focusing on the impacts of habitat sizes on butterfly communities. Environmental factors and other variables such as canopy opening, vegetation covers, humidity and temperature will also be studied in order to understand their relationship that may affect diversity and butterfly communities. The objectives of this research are 1) To study the diversity and distribution of butterflies in several areas of SAFE project; 2) To compare butterfly communities in different sizes of habitat; 3) To study the relationship between butterflies diversity and the environmental factors (canopy opening, vegetation covers, humidity and temperature).","The butterfly sampling will be done in one year period (November 2013 until November 2014). During each of the sampling months, one site will be sampled per month for a consecutive twelve days. For each of the study sites, butterfly sampling will be carried out twice.
Butterflies will be sampled by using aerial net and baited trap. Two types of baits will be used which are ripe bananas and dried anchovy. The transect of 1 km in length and consist of twenty (20) trapping stations will be used. Ten (10) traps will be baited with bananas and additional ten (10) traps will be baited with anchovy. Each of the banana-baited traps will be placed at about 100 m intervals, while the anchovy-baited traps will be placed at about 50 m intervals between the banana-baited trapping stations.
All butterflies that trapped will be identified and their sex determined. Each individual will be marked with felt-tipped pen and released. Large butterflies will be marked with a unique number on the underside of their left hindwing. Smaller butterflies which are too small to put a number on, will be marked with a small spot on the underside of their left hindwing. Butterflies that cannot be identified in the field will be taken as specimens for subsequent identification in the lab using books. The preservation process will be done in the laboratory at UMS.
A densiometer will be used to measure the canopy opening. Humidity and temperature will be taken by using suitable instruments. The vegetation cover will be measured by using estimation.

"SAFE-PRJ-32","Investigating the ecology of a large squamate (Varanus salvator macromaculatus) in altered forest ecosystems, Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia.","800px-Waran1js-150x150.jpg","joshuaptwining@gmail.com","The South-east Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator spp.) is one of the largest, and most widely distributed, squamate lizard complexes in the world (Koch et al,. 2007, Somaweera and Somaweera, 2009, Koch and Bohme, 2010). In Sabah (Borneo, Malaysia) they are apex predators alongside the numerous carnivorous mammalian species (SAFE Project Species Guide, 2012). Little is known about the functional role of monitor lizards in many ecosystems, as their impact has previously been overlooked in favour of placental mammals (Sweet and Pianka 2007). Herpetofaunal community composition and taxonomy as a whole has received little attention in the study area and because of this varanids have largely been ignored (Turner et al. 2012, Ewers, pers comms, 2013).To address the paucity of information on water monitors (Koch et al, 2007), we propose 4 areas of research:
1. Factors affecting the abundance and distribution of water monitors
This study will investigate the relationship between abundance of monitor species (Varanus salvator macromaculatus) to riparian width, habitat type and potential food sources present.
2. Population components and phenotypic trends
Humans are increasingly altering and subsidizing natural food webs in areas where trophic subsidies such as human refuse and carrion are persistent and concentrated within natural habitats. The complex effect of such on wild populations demands investigation (Uyeda, 2009). We propose to investigate the effect of habitat type and the presence of human subsidies on population dynamics and phenotypic trends; i.e. tendency to larger masses, greater aggregations of males in disturbed areas as observed in Jessop et al. (2012).
3. Accompanying fauna
To understand a species ecology gaining knowledge of its faunal composition is essential (Sutherland, 1996), thus in order to recognize changes and disturbances in a community of a species in a specific ecosystem a field study on species ecology cannot exclude biotic factors which in this study include accompanying fauna comprising of crustaceans and vertebrates (Auylia, 2003).
4. Dietary composition
Previous research into the diet of monitors is limited. What exists is contradictory (Gaulke, 1991; Guarino, 2001; Jessop et al. 2010). To determine the effect of habitat and its accompanying fauna on the ecology of a species it is necessary to assess what prey a community is exploiting.","The study will be carried out at 6 sites; 3 sites are previously marked and existing experimental catchments retaining riparian buffer zones; the three riparian land habitat types are; continuous secondary forest, secondary forest surrounded by oil palm, and continuous oil palm. Besides the sites containing riparian widths there will also be 3 control sites in logged forest, oil palm and primary forest (Ewers et al. 2011).
Each site will have sampling sites consisting of a snare trap and a PVC pipe trap placed along transects at a constant distance from the river's edge; the first transect will be 5m from edge and the second, if possible, will run 100m from rivers edge. Each transect will have 5 sampling sites placed at 200 meter intervals.1. Factors affecting the abundance and distribution of water monitors
Trapped individuals will have PIT tags inserted in the left hind leg on the thigh inserting between muscle and skin pointing downwards and gluing insertion point with surgical glue (Ariefandy et al 2013), this will allow recaptures to be instantly recognized and later allow for abundance estimates using capture - mark - recapture (CMR) techniques.2. Population components and phenotypic trendsMorphometric data will be recorded from each individual (SVL, TOL, TL, HL etc).
Traps
The trapping methodology will be adopted from Traeholt (1994; 1997a; 1997b); traps will consist of two approximately 2.5 m long and 35-40 cm high 'walls' made from available substrate. Entrances will be fitted with three 300-lb nylon snares, each fitted onto a 25- 30cm high wooden frame. Traps will be baited with carrion or fish. These traps are used extensively by commercial trappers in the skin trade all over Malaysia (Traeholt, 1997b) and are the best available option when cage traps are implausible (Koch, pers comms, 2012). To avoid any injuries and bi-capture traps will only be opened during capture sessions and during these traps will be checked hourly. Capture sessions will run on individual sites throughout a day from 8:00am - 5:00pm as water monitors display primarily diurnal circadian rhythms (Traeholt, 1995). At the end of the capture session the traps will be closed. Each capture session in a specific trap site will last for 5 consecutive days, over approx. 120 field days this will allow each trap site to be repeated 4 times with an interval of 25 days between repeats.
3. Accompanying fauna
General herpetofaunal biodiversity surveys will be performed daily, 1km line transects will run along parallel to sampling sites; observational data will be recorded and if individuals are caught in hand a basic set of morphometric data will be recorded. Accompanying fauna data will also be collected from bycatches, road kills, stomach contents and general observations.
4. Dietary Composition
Varanids under stress will often flush there stomachs voluntarily (Traeholt, 1994; Gaulke, 1991). Regurgitated prey items of V. salvator (other than the bait) will be collected from the interior of traps. Also in order to record digested prey the hindgut will be palpated to remove fecal pellets following the procedure of Auylia (2003).","2014-01-09","2014-04-10",TRUE,TRUE,"",67,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"

An even more incomplete understanding characterises what is known of the diversity of parasitic groups in this region and most particularly of those groups that are poorly known overall. These include the Myxozoa (a highly enigmatic group of cnidarians only recently recognised to have radiated as endoparasites of aquatic invertebrates and vertebrate hosts), and a diversity of eukaryotic microbes including Ascetosporea (highly diverse, obscure protozoan parasites of invertebrates); X-cell (a recently discovered tumour-forming disease in fish); an alveolate (protozoan) frog pathogen (that may rival the better-known frog disease in impact), and Mesomycetozoa (protist pathogens that branch near the fungal and animal radiations on the tree of life.Our aim is to undertake a combination of environmental and targeted sampling to explore the diversity of parasitic groups including eukaryotic microbes and myxozoans in a diversity of sites and habitats in the Sabah Province of Borneo.","We will adopt environmental sampling to significantly improve on discovery rates of novel parasitic lineages of eukaryotic microbes and myxozoans by avoiding the necessity of finding parasites within host organisms.

Forest modification such as logging and conversion to agricultural uses affects the diversity and abundance of small vertebrate and invertebrate species as a result of changes in food resource availability and other factors. Rainforest habitats in Malaysian Borneo are currently under great pressure due to conversion to monoculture oil palm plantation; in Southeast Asia, deforestation rates have been 1.4% per year in the last decade (Sodhi et al. 2004). Changes in communities of seed dispersing vertebrates and invertebrates are predicted to have a direct impact on ecosystem function, thus it is imperative to understand how and why land use change affects this, as well as to what extent this could be minimised in the future.This project aims to assess how seed dispersal rates are affected by land use change across a habitat gradient, from primary rainforest, through selectively logged forest to oil palm plantation, and whether the relative contribution of invertebrates and vertebrates to those rates changes along the land use gradient. Previous research suggests that insects may be more sensitive to habitat disturbance than vertebrates due to abiotic factors such as humidity (Lewis & Basset 2007), thus my expectation is that the invertebrate role in seed dispersal will be reduced in modified habitats.Questions: 1. Is there a significant difference in rates of seed predation and removal between the different levels of modified habitat? 2. How do patterns of seed dispersal rates across the habitat gradient differ between vertebrates and invertebrates? 3. What factors may be driving these differences and patterns?
These data will provide baseline information on ecological process functioning of forest areas prior to fragmentation.","The project will make use of small wire exclosures placed on the ground, adapted from methods developed by Michael Boyle's project at SAFE, which examined predation pressure between terrestrial and aerial predators. Within all exclosures, invertebrate seed removal rates will be tested via the placement of small, artificial seeds made from an edible substance such as starch. These will solve the issue that a reliable source of seeds of a usable size is unlikely to be easily located within the dipterocarp study area due to supra-annual seed masting of dipterocarp forests, whilst also allowing for control of seed variety (in terms of shape, size and chemical cue) that would naturally be present across the differing habitat areas. Artificial seeds will also differentiate between seed predation that occurs pre-dispersal whilst still on the tree, and post-dispersal once seeds have dropped to the ground as none will have been exposed to insect predators prior to placement in the experimental plot.Seed size and composition will be trialled prior to the study in order to ensure that they can be mobilised by invertebrate predators and simultaneously noticed by larger vertebrate predators. Seeds will be placed upon a brown plastic 'leaf' placed within exclosures to mimic the leaf litter and control for substrate variability. Each experimental plot will compare three treatments: a vertebrate-only exclosure; an invertebrate-only exclosure; and a control with no exclosure. Vertebrate exclosures will be constructed from a small mesh size to prevent entry by small vertebrates, but allow access by invertebrates. Invertebrate exclosures will allow entry by vertebrates but will utilise a non-toxic glue based barrier to prevent access to seeds by terrestrial insects. Controls will exclude neither group and allow both to access the seeds. Treatments will be placed in a triangular arrangement with sufficient distance between each to prevent confounding effects.The effectiveness of the exclosures will be monitored in a sample of plots using camera traps, to ensure that small mammals or other vertebrate taxa are not entering the vertebrate exclosures and to examine the behaviour of the vertebrates approaching the exclosures. Pitfall traps will also be placed within a sample of invertebrate exclosure and control plots to measure invertebrate abundance and thereby determine the effectiveness of the exclosure at excluding invertebrates.
The number of seeds removed from exclosures will be recorded every 12 hours (the initial quantity being known). The precise number of seeds to be placed within each exclosure will be determined during in field trials. Experimental plots will be placed in old growth primary forest, selectively logged forest and in oil palm plantation as a minimum.
The sampling protocol will be based upon the standard SAFE project fractal design, enabling ecological patterns to be inferred at a variety of spatial scales. Habitat variables at each site will be collected and weather data will also be measured at the point of seed placement and data collection.","2013-04-16","2013-07-09",TRUE,TRUE,"",44,"|Plant Science|Zoology|Ecology|"

Changes in anthropogenic land use frequently increase the contact zone between wildlife and humans (ecological driver), yet it is unknown whether habitat disturbances promote virus prevalence in wildlife species, and if it does so, whether chronic stress caused by habitat degradation is increasing virus shedding and transmission risk (physiological driver). In the proposed work, we ask if habitat disturbance causes stress-induced immune-suppression and an increasing virus prevalence in insectivorous bats according to their roosting habit and sociality. We will use sites that reflect the usual sequence of human encroachment in forest habitats (pristine forest, logged forest, fragments) and use a comparative approach in two congeneric pairs of bat species, where pairs differ either in roost choice or sociality. Specifically, we will ask: Does roost ecology affect the virus prevalence in bats in habitats with increasing level of disturbance? Does chronic stress caused by habitat disturbance affect the viral shedding in bats via reduced immune-competence? Does bat sociality affect the virus prevalence in three habitats with increasing level of disturbance? This study will elucidate the role of physiological drivers in promoting the spill-over of viral diseases, and will determine whether physiological drivers act on wildlife species according to their physiological resilience.","The methodological approach is based on two 2-species comparisons within the insectivorous genera Rhinolophus and Kerivoula. Selected species are abundant at the study site so that we anticipate sufficient capture success. To answer our research questions, we will compare the prevalence of selected viruses (not harmful to humans), the immune-competence and maximal plasma cortisol levels in two Rhinolophus species that differ in roost choice. In the two Kerivoula species, we ask how sociality may affect virus prevalence with increasing levels of habitat disturbance. To compare virus prevalence stress response and immune-competence between a species with a dynamic fission-fusion society and another with solitary roosting habits We plan for 40 trapping nights during 4 months of field work resulting in a total of 160 trapping nights during 12 months of field work. To obtain immunological measures that are unbiased by an acute stress response due to handling we will quickly collect droplets of blood from bats when retrieving bats from the pouches of the harp trap. For bleeding, we will pierce one of the uropatagial veins with a sterile needle. Usually 15-80 μl of blood is sufficient for obtaining the relevant immunological measures (Demas et al 2011).

We will take body measures, identify the sex and reproductive condition of females and identify to species following Kingston et al (2006). All individuals of the focal species will be marked using standard metal lipped bat bands. To quantify the maximum cortisol secretion rate in the two Rhinolophus species, we will use a standardized stress stimulus as described in (Greiner et al 2010). Prior to the experiment, we will ensure that bats are not overly bled for obtaining both immunological and hormone data. We will subcutaneously inject adreno- corticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution) which will trigger the release of glucocorticoid hormones. This procedure is not harmful for the animal and we have never experienced any problems. Injection volumes are adjusted to the bats ' body mass. After injection we will keep bats singly in linen bags for 60 minutes. In previous studies glucocorticoid levels peaked around this time following ACTH stimulation (Greiner et al 2010, Lewanzik et al 2012); since we do not know whether the secretion dynamic is similar in Rhinolophus we will validate this period in a subset of animals to ensure that we measure peak secretion rates). We will then bleed animals (about 30-50 μl of blood according to the size of the bat) from the uropatagial vein and transfer blood with Na-heparinised micro-hematocrit tubes into vials. The sample will be centrifuged to obtain plasma. All bats will be released at the site of capture.","2013-09-01","2016-10-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",38,"|Zoology|Ecology|Infectious Diseases|"
"SAFE-PRJ-37","Road building by logging contractors","20130425_080720-150x150.jpg","r.ewers@imperial.ac.uk","Roads are the primary determinant of spatial patterns of deforestation in the tropics and form a crucial base for deforestation models at regional scales. The first new roads in tropical forests are most often created by the timber industry to facilitate the extraction of logs, and those roads take two forms: primary roads along which lorries will transport the logs, and secondary roads along which bulldozers and skidders will haul freshly cut logs out of the forest to landing pads where they are loaded onto lorries.Predicting where new roads will be created is a difficult task that is greatly hindered by a lack of primary data tracking the road building process. Some primary data exists in the Brazilian Amazon from manual interpretation of satellite imagery and the same is true of the Congo forests, but I am not aware of any such data from Borneo. Moreover, satellite-derived logging road maps are likely to have a high false negative rate, missing many small roads and almost all bulldozer trails that are rapidly covered by regrowth.
This project will take advantage of the planned logging of the SAFE Project area to obtain primary data on road building, with a view to using it to parameterise road building models. Data on the exact routes used by lorries and bulldozers will allow me to model the rate and spatial patterns of road creation, providing information on variables such as how roads are built around slopes, preferred locations for building bridges, and the density of roads required to extract timber from an 8,000 ha concession.","I will place GPS dataloggers on each of the bulldozers being used as part of the logging operation at SAFE. The logging company with the concession to cut trees at SAFE has agreed to this, and the onsite foreman and all subcontractors are aware of this decision and have agreed to help. The dataloggers being used come with will strong magnetic clamps that will be used to attach them to bulldozers. They will have their rechargeable batteries replaced, and their data downloaded, every night during the logging operation. Dataloggers will record the latitude, longitude and altitude of each bulldozer once per minute during the day.Road building information will be collected in two phases. In the first phase, logging will remove only the large trees (>35 cm dbh), providing primary data on road construction during selective logging. I anticipate that the second phase, a salvage cut that will remove all trees >10 cm dbh, will be less informative and show only that the entire area will be covered with bulldozer tracks. This will, nonetheless, provide useful data in the form of fine-scale topographic measurements.
In addition to the bulldozer tracks, I will drive all roads in the study area being used to extract logs, and record the locations of all bridges and culverts that have been constructed.
Data will be analysed using methods more commonly associated with quantifying movement patterns of species (Richard and Armstrong 2010, J. Appl. Ecol.). For each section of road, I will select multiple control points by taking random bearings from the same starting point as the road section, and in a straight line of equal distance to the road section. This will allow me to compare features such as the actual slope of the road to control points representing the range of possible slopes that that road section could have taken. In this manner, I can build a statistical description of the routes along which roads are constructed.
The data will have several secondary uses and will be made available to other researchers who require them. Two potential applications are the construction of detailed digital elevation models, and estimating the economic costs of timber extraction across the study area.","2013-05-01","2014-05-01",TRUE,FALSE,"",112,"|Other|"

"SAFE-PRJ-39","The direct and indirect impacts of logging on mammals in Sabah, Borneo","A-Malay-civet-in-Borneo-rarely-seen-during-daylight-hours-110x110.jpg","amy.fitzmaurice13@imperial.ac.uk","This project will provide data on how logging disturbance propagates across space, recording the 'wave' of mammal movements in response to logging, and quantifying resulting 'zones of disturbance'. No previous work has taken this approach, and will highlight the degree of tolerance mammals have to the proximity of logging. The 'disturbance zone' size is important to help design mini-refugia into future logging concessions to minimize the impact of logging on mammal communities. This project will provide baseline data for future analyses of 'temporary de-population' of mammals within a landscape during logging, as we expect that some of the larger species that disperse away from the logging disturbance will ultimately recolonize remaining forest fragments. No other study has been able to quantity these effects. This research builds on past work examining mammal communities at the SAFE project, but the timing of this study to coincide exactly with logging activities ensures it has novel angles that complement, without duplicating earlier work, while contributing data towards knowledge of bushmeat harvest in Borneo, but also an international level, through possible trade links. Logging creates increased access by way of roads and skid trails that are then used to hunt along (GCP, 2013).
The aims include:
1. Investigate the impacts of logging on mammal species occurrence before logging and during logging.
2. Investigate the spatial impacts of logging bulldozer movements on mammal species presence and develop 'zones of disturbance', providing data for management to establish buffer zones around forests during logging to reduce environmental impacts.
3. Investigate the 'crowding effect' and 'dispersal effect' in mammals due to direct and indirect impacts of logging.
4. Investigate bushmeat hunting by logging workers and palm oil workers in forest habitat, logged habitat and palm oil plantations.
The specific sampling sites and spatial scale are still in design stage, as the mapping of bulldozer data is currently happening, which will determine which sampling sites we set the camera traps up in.","Aim 1: Non-invasive camera trap research is ongoing at the SAFE project. Previously collected data (Oliver Wearn - collaborator) of mammal species before logging will be compared to data collected during April to July 2014 while logging is occurring. Occupancy analysis can be conducted to investigate the changes in the number and composition of species between the two time points of pre-logged and logged (Schuette et al. 2013 and Wearn et al. 2013).
Aim 2: GPS will be placed on each bulldozers used by the logging company working at the SAFE project (Usahawan Borneo), providing data on physical boundaries of logging disturbance through the 'Zones of disturbance', where mammal species will be quantified by examining changes in occupancy from camera trap data in relation to distance from bulldozer activity.
Aim 3: Mapping of 'crowding' and 'dispersal' effects of species from camera trap data in relation to the GPS coordinates of bulldozers to understand species tolerance to logging activities using GIS software. Crowding - clusters of species and dispersal - a movement of an individual or species beyond its normal distribution. The hunting data can be overlapped on top of the produced maps to investigate key areas of disturbance and whether hunting activity may be an additional factor in mammal movements.
Aim 4: Bushmeat surveys will be conducted on the logging workers and palm oil workers around the SAFE project, taking advantage of existing friendly relationships between SAFE project members and logging and plantation crews. Bushmeat hunting is often conducted illegally and respondents may be reluctant in sharing sensitive information. To minimize non-responses and biases, specialized questioning techniques will be used, such as unmatched count technique (UCT), which has been shown to increase response rates and respondent understanding (Nuno et al. 2013). The specific technique and design will be defined after knowing the expected sample size in order to increase its statistical efficiency and surveys will be piloted to minimize errors and increase respondent understanding. Proposed questions for collection include - who is hunting, which species they hunt, where they hunt, how often they hunt and do they eat or sell the bushmeat, while collecting variables such as social demographic characteristics. GIS software will be used to analyze and map data on the disturbance of hunting effort between forest and plantation, and patterns will be statistically analysed using multivariate regression analysis.","2014-04-25","2014-07-23",FALSE,FALSE,"",116,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|"

Each environmental change can have a significant effect on habitat quality and microclimatic conditions, which can affect vector abundance, survivorship, human biting behaviour and vector competence (Patz et al. 2000; Afrane et al. 2008). Land use change has been linked to emerging and re-emerging diseases (Gratz et al. 1999), especially zoonotic pathogens. As zoonotic pathogens tend to have high fertility rates and no reliable cure, vaccine or therapy (e.g. Nipah virus in Malaysia), they must be monitored to avoid public health disasters (Patz et al. 2004). This project will investigate how mosquito community dynamics are affected by tropical deforestation and fragmentation. Three main questions will be addressed:1)      What is the effect of land use change on the human-landing rate, diversity and composition of mosquitoes
2)      What are the impacts of deforestation and fragmentation on mosquito abundance, community composition and public health
3)      What is the impact of deforestation and agricultural development on malaria epidemiology?
The overall outcome of the project is to collect extensive data on mosquito presence, diversity, abundance, and disease rates within Sabah. This will be used to identify if land use change, including deforestation and fragmentation, has a big impact on mosquito community dynamics and infection rates.","Question 1: Ovitrap surveillance and bare leg catches (BLC) will be used to measure the human-landing rate, diversity and community composition of mosquitoes. Ovitrap surveillance will be carried out in the SAFE Project 2nd order points of blocks B, C, D, E, OG2, OG3, OP1 and OP3. They will also be placed around villages within Benta Wawasan estates (Belian and Selangan Batu). BLC will be carried out in the SAFE Project 2nd order points of blocks D, E, OP1, OP2, OP3, OG2 and OG3. Two ovitraps will be used; a larger one (see Brant 2011, MSc. Thesis) and a smaller one based on the design of Lenhart et al. (2005). The smaller ovitrap will consist of a dark plastic container (diameter 7 cm, depth=10 cm), with an overflow hole near the rim of the container to avoid overflow of water during heavy rain (Yap & Thiruvengadam 1979; Rozilawati et al. 2007).  It will be tied 1 m high to trees, or underneath houses in the villages. A piece of cotton cloth (12 cm x 27 cm) will be placed within the ovitraps as an ovipositional substrate, and 200 ml of sterilised water is then added. All ovitraps are placed under heavy shade, measured by a densiometer, to ensure mosquitoes will be attracted to the traps. Water temperature and canopy cover are to be recorded at each site during the set-up of ovitraps. After six days, the traps will be collected and all ovipositional substrates are dried and placed in individual plastic bags. All water is carried back to the laboratory, for larvae to be counted and reared through to adults for identification. Eggs will be counted on the ovipositional substrates and the rim of the ovitraps by using a dissection microscope. After counting, unhatched eggs will be placed in water to hatch out. The human landing rate of mosquitoes will be measured using BLC. A pilot study demonstrated that mosquitoes in SAFE Project 2nd order points (block E, D, OP3, OG2) had peak Anopheles biting period occurring between 18:00-23:00 h. Within pairs, the collectors, with the aid of red torch lights, will aspirate mosquitoes off their own legs for the first 50 minutes of each hour, and then rest and prepare a new sampling cup for the remaining 10 minutes. Collected mosquitoes will be placed in cups covered with a net cloth, and a new cup will be used during every hour of collection. Mosquitoes will then be taken back to the field laboratory to be killed and sorted into individual tubes with silica gel. Identification of Anopheles species will occur at the Universiti of Malaya, and the other genera at the Natural History Museum (London). Question 2: Post logging data collection will be conducted; using the same methods mentioned in Question 1. Question 3: data from previous malaria cases will be collected from local medical clinics. These will be mapped against land use and land cover maps to see if there's a trend between deforestation and malaria cases.","2012-02-07","2014-10-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",28,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Infectious Diseases|"

Conversion of forest for agricultural purposes cause the ecosystem to change. Shifting the dominance of plant and animal diversity will cause the functions or the ecological cycle to be altered. One famous example is the decomposition processes. By removing the litter layer, the arthropod diversity will be affected. Decomposition is important as it returns the nutrients back to the soil to ensure the quality of the soil. When the nutrient cycle is disturbed, no nutrient will be returned, thus the growth of new plants will be disrupted and may be halted.Thus, the study to the effects of human disturbance towards the community of litter arthropods is very important in understanding the relationships between the arthropod community and the ecosystem in order to conserve and maintain our forest quality as well as providing more data for current research and ideas for the future.","Trampling effect
To study the effects of human trampling on litter arthropods, litter sample will be extracted from 100m transect along trails where trampling occur. Parallel transects to the first one are set side by side at a distance of 15m, 30m, and 45m to the left and right of the first transect. This may show differences in term of arthropods diversity and density when the level of disturbance is reduced as we walk away from the trail.Litter removal
To measure the effects of litter removal, sampling will be conducted at an oil palm plantation. Sampling will also be carried out in the area with more vegetation and thicker litter layer (ie. Maliau Basin) as a comparison. Arthropods composition will be compared and the difference (ie. the dominant group or the abundance)will be directly analyse.Curation and identification
All arthropods will be preserve in the ethanol and labelled. Identification of litter arthropods is very hard since it is so diverse. Thus, I will be focusing more on the dominant groups. Dominant group are those who commonly found in high number on litter layer such as ants (Hymenoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera). Other order of arthropods will still be collected but only identified until their order.Data analysis
To test the diversity of the litter arthropods, diversity test will be conducted. Shannon-Weiner and Simpson diversity index will be used to estimate the diversity of litter invertebrates at the manipulated area and control area for both trampling and litter removal experiment.
Nested ANOVA analysis will be conducted to test for the significant different of litter arthropods abundance for the trampling effect experiment. Meanwhile, for the litter removal experiment, I will directly observe the change of litter arthropods composition.
Environmental data at each location will be taken (temperature, humidity, pH, canopy cover, elevation, light intensity, and geographical attributes) and a non-parametric test will be used to compare these variables.","2012-10-01","2014-10-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",34,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-41","The impact of invertebrates and fungi on litter decomposition rate in modified forests","leaf-litter-safe-110x110.jpg","nichola.plowman11@imperial.ac.uk","Invertebrates and fungi play important roles in many ecosystem processes including the decomposition of organic matter. The presence of invertebrates greatly accelerates litter decomposition and nutrient release in tropical forests worldwide (Meyer et al, 2011; Schädler & Brandl, 2005) but their impact can differ from site to site depending on litter mix and decomposer community (Powers et al, 2009).
The conversion of primary rainforest to secondary forest through to intensively managed plantations will change the diversity and community structure of fungi and invertebrates. These changes could impact their essential role in the breakdown of organic material and recycling of nutrients. Forest fragmentation can alter leaf litter decomposition rates(Didham, 1998).
This project aims to quantify the relative impact of invertebrates and fungi on Sabah's forest litter decomposition across a range of habitat degradation. We will do this by a factorial exclosure experiment (excluding macroinvertebrates, excluding fungi, or excluding both) that will monitor decomposition rates in primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation.The study attempts to address the following questions:
1) What impact does the presence of invertebrates and fungi have on decomposition rate?
2) Does their impact depend on the degree of habitat modification?
3) What is the relative impact of invertebrates and fungi on litter decomposition rate and does this differ across the different habitats?
4) To what extent do fungi and invertebrates interact in decomposition, and does this change according to the degree of habitat modification?","Leaf litter will be collected in each of the SAFE Project vegetation plots using litter traps which are cleared and left to collect naturally senesced leaves. Complete leaves will be selected, oven dried and cut into 2cm pieces, discarding any large veins and petioles. The pieces will be pooled for each level of habitat modification, ensuring, for example, that litter collected in primary forest is left to decompose in primary forest. In oil palm habitat,
plantation management routinely shear off understory fronds and lay them on the ground, so we will collect randomly selected fronds to dry and prepare in the same way as described above.
Four treatments will be applied: invertebrates absent/fungi absent, invertebrates absent/fungi present, invertebrates present/fungi absent and invertebrates present/ fungi present (control). Dried leaf preparations will be weighed into 4 gram samples and placed in 10cm2 bags with a mesh size of 1mm. Three 1cm2 perforations will be made in each side of the control bags to allow access to macroinvertebrates. For macroinvertebrate exclusion, bags will have no perforations. For fungal exclusion, a broad spectrum fungicide (chlorothalonil, captan, or benonyl) will be sprayed on the litter bags at close
range and reapplied every 2 weeks, by lifting the bags onto a plastic sheets then replacing them (as in Sayer et al, 2006). Other bags will be sprayed with a water control. In each plot, we will place 16 leaf litter bags (four of each treatment). Bags will be placed randomly (at least 2m apart to avoid interactions with fungicide treatments) but tied together with fishing twine to facilitate easy collection in the field. We will collect one bag from each treatment approximately every 14 days for 8 weeks. Litter will be oven
dried and weighed to determine change in mass.

"SAFE-PRJ-42","Tree transpiration rates near forest edges","2012-11-28-13.26.23-150x150.jpg","stephen.hardwick10@imperial.ac.uk","Observations of tree mortality rates in Amazonia have shown that large trees are particularly vulnerable to forest fragmentation. Near forest edges large tree mortality rates were 181% higher than in the interior, while small and medium tree mortality rates increased by around 100% (Laurance et al, 2000). One reason for this is that large trees are more susceptible to drought and water stress (Nepstad et al, 2007). At tropical forest edges, air humidity decreases, air temperature increases and wind speeds can increase, therefore, it is reasonable to expect that tree transpiration rates may increase and, therefore, trees at forest edges may become more water stressed (Giambelluca et al, 2003).
The aim of this experiment is to look for differences in tree transpiration, using sap flow as a proxy, in large and small trees near a forest edge and at the interior of a forest fragment, before and after isolation of the fragment.
There are two main hypotheses to be tested:
1. Trees near the forest edge will have higher sap flow rates after fragment isolation has occurred than they did prior to isolation.
2. Large trees will have a greater increase in sap flow post-isolation than small trees.
The SAFE project offers a rare opportunity to study sap flow rates in the same trees before and after fragmentation, which as far as we know has never been done before.","Sap flow rates will be measured for paired large and small trees near the fragment edge and at the fragment interior, both before and after fragment isolation has occurred. Sap flow rates will be monitored using thermal dissipation probe sets, as originally designed by Granier (1985). Thermal dissipation probe sets consist of two metal probes that are inserted radially into a tree's sapwood, a fixed vertical distance (usually around 10cm) apart. The upper probe is heated and the moving sap dissipates heat from this probe. The temperature difference between the two probes is monitored. A faster sap flow rate dissipates more heat and thus reduces the temperature difference between the two probes.
This experiment will use a total of eight thermal dissipation probes and each tree will be monitored for one month. Therefore, at any one time there will be two large and two small trees being monitored in each zone. Isolation of the fragment is expected to occur around six months after the start of the experiment and, therefore, there will be time for 12 large and 12 small trees to be monitored in each zone. After isolation is completed, the same 48 trees will have their sap flow rates re-measured. During the second phase of measurements, probes will be placed at the same height as the first set of readings were taken, but at a slight azimuthal distance away from the first set of readings. This will avoid any slight anomalies in the sap flow rate that have occurred due to the tree's healing mechanisms, but will also avoid potential errors due to azimuthal asymmetries in the tree's sap flow rates.
Measurements of rainfall and air temperature taken at the SAFE project weather station throughout the experiment will be used to check for potential pre and post-isolation sap flow rate differences due to different local climatic conditions.
By using the same trees and placing the sensors in very similar positions in the trunk the most commonly reported errors from previous studies can be avoided. These include errors due to azimuthal asymmetry in sap flow, differences between different species, problems due to uncertainty in the fraction of the probes in contact with sapwood and problems in the calibration of the relationship between the measured temperature difference and the sap flux density. Although it will be necessary to consider all of these error sources and attempt to correct for them for some analyses, the main hypotheses of this experiment can be tested for just by using before and after figures for ∆T, the temperature difference between the two probes.","2013-04-01","2014-04-01",TRUE,FALSE,"",40,"|Water Resources|Plant Science|Ecology|Microclimate|"

LAI serves as the dominant control over primary production transpiration and energy exchange LAI ranges from 0 (bare ground) to > 10 (dense forest), and determines the interception of solar energy (and thus partly fAPAR) for photosynthesis. Gross Primary Production can be estimated from fAPAR (GPP = e × fAPAR × PAR).BPS is a crucial component of dynamic vegetation models. Changes in bio - geophysical structure may alter heat and energy fluxes at the terrestrial surface affecting regional climate or altering surface conditions leading to new states of climate and ecosystems.BPS is biome - specific and region - specific. Its estimation can be time - consuming and labour - intensive. Indirect approaches (i.e. hemispherical photography) now enable more time - efficient rapid canopy structure assessments over larger areas. Remote sensing can then be used to upscale BPS derived at plot level using spectral vegetation indices (VI). Given satellite time series are available, temporal BPS - VI relationships across landscapes can then be analysed.This study will evaluate spatio - temporal heterogeneity in vegetation biophysical structure at the SAFE site We will quantify links between BPS and other forest processes such as production of biomass and carbon sequenstration and test for links to biodiversity indicators. Hemispherical photography will be used to quantify BPS in old growth forests logged and experimental forest blocks to assess changes in BPS under fragmentation and logging impacts Subsequent BPS quantifications are planned to analyse seasonal BPS dynamics and their links to weather variability.","BPS sampling and mapping will follow a standardised protocol developed by Pfeifer & Gonsamo (2011 ): http imperial academia edu MarionPfeifer Teaching Measuring_vegetation_canopy_structure_ - _Leaf_Area_Index_LAI_Sampling will be carried out in existing vegetation monitoring plots in A - F Old Growth Forest Oil Palm plantations and Logged Forests. Plots will be chosen to be at least at a distance of ≥ 100 m from the edge (to allow for coarse pixel validation in subsequent satellite image analyses). All images sampled in a plot (≥ 12 images per 25 m x 25 m pixel) must be acquired in similar illumination conditions so that the variability in colour dynamics between all the images that are processed together is minimal.Acquisition of images: Ideally hemispherical measurements should be performed under overcast conditions to minimize anisotropy of the sky radiance. The aim is to avoid sun glares or sunflecks when taking upward hemispherical images to avoid very over - exposed parts in the image which may make the class allocation more difficult in subsequent image processing. If the image is taken in the upward direction use a tripod, with the camera levelled. The upper picture margin should be facing exactly northward at each image, at 1 m above ground (or another height as long as you always use the same).Pre - Processing of images: After downloading from the camera system each image has to be pre - processed. The pixel brightness values for the blue band is extracted from each RGB image to achieve maximum contrast between leaf and sky because absorption of leafy materials is maximal and sky scattering tends to be highest in that band. We use the global Ridler method (Ridler & Calvard) for image thresholding ( see Pfeifer et al 2012), because of reliable results in hemispherical photography studies (Jonckheere et al, 2005).
Image analysis: The resulting binary images will be analysed using the canopy analysis software CAN - EYE V6 (Weiss & Baret) limiting the field of view of the lens to values between and 0 and 60° to avoid mixed pixels and thus misclassifications. CAN - EYE estimates mean effective LAI for each plot (LAI_EFF; assuming randomly located foliage) based on a series of (at least) 8 images from measured gap fraction. LAI_EFF is derived by inversion of the Poisson model using look - up tables and assuming an ellipsoidal distribution of leaf inclination. A clumping index is computed using the Lang & Yueqin logarithm gap fraction averaging method and used in a modified Poisson model which is then inverted to estimate LAI_TRUE (LAI taking into account canopy clumping). Note that estimated LAI includes foliage materials such as stems, trunks, branches, twigs and plant reproductive parts and is more accurately called plant area index (PAI).","2012-08-02","2012-08-15",TRUE,TRUE,"",75,"|Plant Science|Ecology|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Biogeochemistry|"

With increasing temperatures, species may shift and new diseases may spread. The data will be useful for future projects, to identify how the mosquito species have spread based on increasing temperatures.The main question is, is there a difference in the diversity and abundance of mosquito populations within the three study areas.","The primary forest, logged forest and the oil palm plantation control area will be compared by catching mosquitoes within each site. These mosquitoes will be sampled by using standardized mosquito traps (ovitraps), which are able to collect mosquitoes from a range of genera.
Mosquitoes lay eggs in a variety of ways, so there will be a trap for Anopheles species and a trap for Culex & Aedes species at each site. Each area will have a certain number of traps so that the areas can be compared. Ponds, leaf litter, standing water and other likely mosquito
habitats will also be sampled by larval dipping within these areas. Habitat features, such as canopy cover, surrounding vegetation, leaf litter etc. will be measured so that each site can be compared. All eggs, larvae and pupae will be reared through to adults as identification is easier at adult level. Adult mosquitoes will then be sorted into family, and then preserved.

Although there have been many studies on the impacts of habitatdegradation and fragmentation on diversity in tropical forests, the cascading functional consequencesof these anthropogenic drivers remain poorly understood, despite their clear importance for ecological sustainability and future conservation and management strategies. Thus, a key challenge for tropical conservation biologists is to assess how forest management practices affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. We explore the consequences of human use and modification of rainforests for a functionally important group of insects (dung beetles) and the ecosystem functions that they perform.Specific aims:

Consequently changes in the composition of this group may effect forest regeneration and succession (Terborgh et al. 2001). In tropical forests, small mammals often increase in abundance and species richness after human disturbance (Adler and Levins 1994, Lambert et al. 2003). The functional significance of this group means that there is a fundamental need to understand what elements of the disturbance regime support this change in order to inform policy on future disturbance regimes that may allow for the long-term persistence of these species. It is possible to investigate this question by examining the differences in microhabitat use of small mammals in logged and unlogged forest. It has been suggested that small mammal habitat use is driven by their need for predator avoidance (Wells et al. 2006) and available resource (Adler 2000). Therefore if the forest disturbance regime changes the ability of small mammals to meet these primary needs, this may explain changes in community composition. Specifically I aim to ask 1) what habitat characteristics most strongly predict microhabitat use by small mammal species and 2) does the availability of these characteristics differ between logged and unlogged forests?","This project will involve live trapping of small non - volant mammals in grids of varying size ( between ha and ha plots ) in logged and unlogged forest The sampling methods and nested design establishes a hierarchy of sampling scales from microhabitat use by individual small mammals up to land - use type Spool - and - line tracking will be used to assess fine scale microhabitat selection of small mammal species ( Wells et al Harris et al ). This method involves attaching a bobbin of thread ( spool ) to an animal and the end of the thread is attached to vegetation or a rock at the release point The spool unravels from the inside so that as the animal moves the thread plays out without resistance attaching to vegetation and rocks ( Boonstra and Craine ). The trail can then be followed the next day to quantify the individual â€™ s microhabitat selection ( Cox et al ). It is important to quantify microhabitat selection at a spatial scale relevant to the species of interest In this study the spatial unit of separation between habitat assessments will be equal to movement step lengths distance of spool - and - line on the same bearing through similar habitat ( Wells et al ). At the end point of each step habitat covariates will be quantified to assess the microhabitat preference of the individual Control covariates will be recorded by walking the distance equal to the step length on a bearing of Â° and Â° from the direction chosen by the small mammal In this way the microhabitat selected by the small mammal can be compared with the available alternative habitats The microhabitat selected by small mammals will be characterized in terms of covariates relating to resource availability predator avoidance and habitat type Invertebrate biomass an invertebrate biomass contour map will be generated for each trapping grid by placing one yellow - white fly and aphid sticky trap at each each trap location for days The number and size class of invertebrates will be recorded and invertebrate biomass estimated by Rogers et al ( ) length - to - weight equation The invertebrate biomass moved through will be estimated for each step and the direction of travel in relation to the invertebrate biomass gradient will be estimated Volume of fallen wood > cm diameter fallen woody matter provides a substrate to facilitate movement of small mammals ( Bernard ).

"SAFE-PRJ-50","The impacts of tropical forest degradation and fragmentation on ant-plant mutualisms, and consequences for plant community dynamics","","dan.lestina@gmail.com","Ongoing anthropogenic habitat modification is resulting in new sets of species coming into contact with each other. These novel species interactions arise from the extinction of some species, new arrivals of others and changes in the abiotic environment. However, impacts of anthropogenic habitat modification on mutualistic species interaction networks have not been well quantified.Macaranga are widespread and common early succession trees, which provide shade for desirable late-succession trees. Mutualistic interactions between Macaranga trees and Crematogaster ants, aiding the trees in this role, are one of the most diverse in SE Asia. They therefore represent an ideal model system for study of interaction network dynamics in altered environment. The research focuses on six specific hypotheses: 1) Macaranga host tree communities change with habitat degradation and regeneration. 2) The Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction network is affected by habitat. 3) Protection of plants by ants from herbivores changes with habitat degradation. 4) The provision of food and living space by trees to ants in return for protection is affected by habitat degradation. 5) The specific arrangement of habitat fragments will determine which ant and plant populations can persist at larger scales in degraded landscapes. 6) This symbiotic interaction is important in regeneration of heavily logged forests, fragmented forest, and oil palm plantations.","1) We will collate data on the distribution of all Macaranga across the range of land-use types. We will analyse data based on these trees to determine community patterns in Macaranga composition in relation to disturbance and regeneration. We will also include a number of environmental covariates: air and soil temperature and humidity, canopy cover, vegetation structure, plant species composition, leaf litter depth, humus depth, litter volume, and dead wood density. We will also carry out parallel analyses on abundances of individual Macaranga species, to test the hypothesis that species involved in more generalist interactions should be more robust to habitat change. We will use multivariate methods to analyse how Macaranga species composition changes with disturbance. 2) To quantify shifts in Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction networks we will assess ant interactions with all Macaranga trees smaller than 5m in height in selected plots. We will analyse overall interaction network specificity metrics. These metrics will be used as response variables in a series of statistical analyses (as above). We will e.g. test whether the degree of specificity of Macaranga species in primary forest in terms of their ant symbionts predicts their vulnerability to habitat change. 3) Assays will be made for rates of ant patrolling and ant attacks on a model herbivore (termite worker). We will survey externally feeding herbivore communities on these trees by beating entire small trees, in order to test directly whether ant presence reduces herbivore numbers, communnity composition and biomass. In order to get measures of plant fitness, we will extract growth rate and flowering/fruiting data from the SAFE database for all trees > 1 cm DBH, allowing assessment of whether occupancy by different ant species differentially affects growth rates or reproduction for particular Macaranga species, whether this varies between Macaranga species, and whether these dependencies are altered by habitat change. 4) Macaranga provision of food bodies and extra floral nectar will be assessed following established methods. For the same species pairs, but from individuals outside of our monitoring plots, we will make collections of scale insects (Coccus spp.) tended by the Crematogaster living inside Macaranga hollow stems, since plant feeding of ants may be mediated via sap-sucking insects. This will also allow the opportunity to assess plant provisioning of living space to ants. 5) We will first survey all selected Macaranga species at increasing distances into oil palm from a source population in logged. We will then explore the landscape-scale dynamics of this mutualistic interaction network by creating an individual-based metacommunity simulation model. Dispersal rates of ants and plants will be parameterised using fitted curves of dispersal along the transects. 6) We will conduct experimental ant removals (away from permanent SAFE/SBE plots) to see whether any reduced Macaranga viability from loss of ant protection decreases recruitment rates of shade-demanding dipterocarps. We will also conduct a series of transplants of three focal obligate myrmecophyte Macaranga species at increasing distances into continuous oil palm plantation.

To best conserve the natural heritage of this diverse region, it is therefore vital that we identify effective ways to maintain threatened species and habitats within these modified landscapes.The preservation of forest corridors along rivers, known as riparian strips, is becoming an increasingly widespread feature of land management within the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The State of Sabah Water Resources Enactment (1998) states that a 20m buffer of riparian forest is required either side of any river greater than 3m in width. Since 2005, the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)
has also listed the preservation of riparian strips of as part of their principles and criteria for sustainable palm oil production.An important function of these riparian strips of forest is to improve water quality within the river system. However, awareness of the habitat value of these forest areas for terrestrial plant and animal species is rapidly growing. The Regional Forum on Enhancing Forest Ecosystems Connectivity and Corridors within the Heart of Borneo in Sabah (held in Kota Kinabalu in Oct 2009) highlighted the importance of riparian forest corridors for the conservation of many animals, particularly large
vertebrates such as the Orangutan. The value of riparian forest strips has also been demonstrated for avifauna, although much of this research focuses on temperate regions of North America (e.g. Stauffer & Best 1980; Darveau et al. 1995; Deschênes et al. 2003; Shirley & Smith 2005).To further investigate the value of this conservation strategy, I will focus on the tropical forest ecosystems within Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. As the benefit of riparian strips for arthropod taxa is particularly poorly known (Marczak et al. 2001), I intend to study two insect groups of functional importance within these systems: ants and dung beetles.Questions:
1. How does ant and dung beetle community structure within the riparian strips compare to that of riparian areas within continuous forest and riparian areas within continuous oil palm (focus of fieldwork in 2011).
2. How do ecosystem functions performed by these taxa vary across the different riparian land uses (focus of fieldwork in 2011).
3. Do riparian strips alter the species composition of the surrounding oil palm, and the ecosystem services delivered to it (intended focus of fieldwork in 2012).
4. Does the width of the riparian strip affect the community composition of these taxa and the associated ecosystem functions (intended focus of fieldwork in 2013)","Question 1:a) The dung beetle community will be sampled using pitfall traps baited with cattle dung (Slade et al.
2007; Hayes et al. 2009). 6 replicate transects will be run at a constant distance to the stream edge
within each of the three riparian land use types (continuous secondary forest, forest strip surrounded
by oil palm, and continuous oil palm). Transects within continuous secondary forest will be placed
upstream of the datalogger sites within SAFE project experimental watersheds (prior to conversion in
July 2011). Replicate transects within riparian forest strips and continuous oil palm will be placed in the
surrounding agricultural matrix.b) The leaf litter ant community will be sampled using the dung baited pitfall traps and winkler bags.c) The diurnal leaf litter scavenger ant community will be sampled by collecting voucher specimens
from bait removal experiments (e.g. Ness 2004; Gove et al. 2007; Lomov et al. 2009).Question 2:a) Dung removal will be quantified by recording the mass loss of equal volume dung pats left along
each replicate transect for 24 hours (e.g. Slade et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2009; Amezquita & Favila 2010)b) Leaf litter ant scavenging activity will be assessed through direct observation of bait removal
(protein and carbohydrate rich food substances as well as dead insects) (e.g. Bestelmeyer & Wiens
2003; Farwig et al. 2009).c) Decomposition of organic matter within the leaf litter and soil will be assessed using Bait Lamina
Strips (plastic strips with 16 cavities loaded with bait). The strips can be both inserted into the ground
and left above ground. After a standardised number of days, the perforated or emptied cavities along
each strip are counted. This method can be repeated with native plant species or oil palm fronds as the
primary component of the bait substance (Kratz 1998; Knacker et al. 2003; Hamel et al. 2007).d) I will compare data collected using Bait Lamina Strips to that acquired by measuring the mass loss of
leaf litter within litter bags (e.g. González & Seastedt 2001; Powers et al. 2009).Question 3:
Using the methods described above, I hope to sample the ant and dung beetles communities at varying
distances from replicate streams with and without riparian forest strips. Similarly, I will measure dung
removal and decomposition rates of organic material (e.g. oil palm fronds) to assess whether the
presence of riparian strips affects these ecosystem services.
Question 4:
Following conversion to oil palm, I will also intend to repeat data collection along each of the replicate
transects within the experimental watersheds. As these watersheds will vary in the width of the
riparian forest strip that is left, I will be able to assess whether riparian strip width affects species

A huge percentage of Southeast Asian rainforests has been degraded and fragmented as a result of human activity (Woodruff 2010). Deforestation by logging and agricultural development is the biggest threat, and natural habitats are being destroyed at an alarming rate. Although leaf-litter ant communities are relatively robust to logging (Woodcock et al. 2011), it is expected that canopy communities will be more affected, since the removal of trees directly affects their habitat.

It is therefore of interest to document their responses to the habitat fragmentation that is presently occurring across the globe.

This means that experimental fragmentation projects, in which pre and post-fragmentation ant communities can be compared, are needed properly understand ant community dynamics in these landscapes, and the effect of these dynamics on ant-mediated ecosystem processes. This project will address three major questions:
1. How does forest conversion and fragmentation affect litter-dwelling ant communities?
2. Do ant communities become less vertically stratified in disturbed habitats?
3. How do these changes in ant community composition affect the ecosystem processes being performed by the ant community as a whole?","1. How does forest conversion and fragmentation affect litter-dwelling ant communities?
Litter-dwelling ants, collected biannually at 1st order fractal sampling points using pitfall traps as part of the core SAFE project, are being identified to genus and morphospecies by a team of parataxonomists under the supervision of TMF and ECT. Two sets of collections will be made prior to fragmentation, followed by a further nine years of collections post-fragmentation. This will allow us to determine responses of ant communities to local habitat complexity in terms of alpha and beta diversity, as well as in terms of trophic partitioning, assessed by stable isotope analysis and possibly genetic barcoding of ant gut contents.
2. Do ant communities become less vertically stratified in disturbed habitats?
The canopies of North Bornean rain forest are the highest in the tropics, extending up to 90m above the ground. Ants utilise this habitat, from deep in the soil to the tips of the branches of the highest trees. One postulated response of animal and plant communities to fragmentation is that communities will become “concertinaed”, with species usually present high in the canopy in old growth forest moving closer to ground level as canopies become more open, and hence microclimatic niches shift downwards (Sutton 2008; Fayle et al. 2009 for epiphytic ferns). Since microclimate is known to strongly structure ant communities, we would expect them to track the microclimate shift and so we should get a progressive concertinaing of the communities: old growth forest Ant communities will be sampled at 2nd order fractal points using modified baited traps based on a method used by Ryder-Wilkie (2007) for both above and below-ground faunas in order to
answer this question. This project will be carried out in collaboration with Kalsum Mohd. Yusah (University of Cambridge, Universiti Malaysia Sabah).
3. How do these changes in ant community composition affect the ecosystem processes being performed by the ant community as a whole?
While it is well known how ant communities are variously effected by logging (Widodo et al. 2004, Berry et al. 2010, Woodcock et al. In review), fragmentation (Bruhl et al. 2003) and habitat conversion (Fayle et al 2010, Bruhl and Eltz 2010), it less clear how these changes affect the rates at which ant-mediated processes occur. Assays for rates of ant-mediated nutrient redistribution and predation will be conducted at 2nd order fractal sampling points. Assessment of ant-mediated nutrient redistribution will follow Fayle et al. (2010), but using a more ecologically realistic substrate than tuna and biscuit! We are also interested in developing a method for assessing rates of ant-mediated seed dispersal that can be used across the entire habitat gradient.","2010-11-01","2020-01-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",16,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"

organisation, with tightly organised colonies and workers that are well adapted
for nesting and foraging in the soil and rotting vegetation, has enabled them to
become the only eusocial predators to occupy this major niche (Moreau et al.

fragmentation throughout the tropics, and in particular in SE Asia. The aim of
this research is to document the changes in diversity and composition of ant

stratified forest, will the ants from the upper canopy amass on the forest floor

"SAFE-PRJ-56","Assessment of ant biodiversity in Malaysian oil palm plantations in relation to stand age and across spatial scales","Ant_close_0712_small-110x110.jpg","wyw24@cam.ac.uk","No study has yet examined the variation in ant assemblages within oil palm plantations and across a larger spatial scale, i.e. between distinct tracts of plantation or forest. Habitat heterogeneity, and consequently species diversity, is thought to be minimal in agricultural monocultures such as oil palm, but this presumption may not apply to plantations that typically comprise mosaics of different-aged tree stands. Stand age may contribute to eterogeneity and significant environmental variation within a single habitat. This holds major implications for the management and conservation of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, the first objective of this project is to investigate the responses of litter ant biodiversity to oil palm stand age. The effects of stand age on invertebrate biodiversity have been evaluated in other plantation types, such as pine, leading to the development of various agroforestry techniques designed to maintain critical structural attributes that support a wider range of species at the forest stand scale.
The second objective of this project is to compare the beta diversity of ants across agricultural landscapes and also across comparable spatial scales of pristine forests. Tropical insects in general are often under-represented in conservation biology, although the integration of insect distribution data on broader scales is central towards the identification and sustainable management of biodiversity hotspots. We therefore want to study the diversity of ants across multiple oil palm plantations separated by varied spatial distances and determine factors that contribute to similarities or dissimilarities between assemblages at each site.
In order to provide a robust control for assessing the importance of ant beta diversity in oil palm, it is essential that we carry out a comparable assessment of ant diversity across similar spatial scales in the pre-conversion landscape, primary forest. Previous studies have shown that there is a generally negative effect of oil palm conversion on forest ant fauna, but much more remains to be done to quantify the impacts of this crop on ant distribution across broader spatial scales. A clear understanding of how ant communities vary in converted landscapes is necessary for use of ant diversity as a reliable indicator of environmental health, since ants influence many ecosystem services in habitats where they thrive.Overall, we aim to address three main questions:1) What are the responses of litter ant diversity to oil palm stand age (young/mature/old), 2) How does ant diversity change with varying spatial scales between discrete oil palm plantations (beta diversity), and 3) How does beta diversity of ants in an oil palm landscape differ from that in a primary forest landscape?","Ant sampling will be conducted at separate oil palm plantations in parts of Sabah (Malaysia), and a corresponding number of primary forest sites within the same vicinity, i.e. Danum Valley, the Maliau Basin and Tabin Reserve, over a period of two field seasons, each spanning approximately 5 months. All sites will be at lowland elevation.In each oil palm plantation, I will undertake sampling within blocks of differently-aged oil palm stands.
Oil palm stands can be approximately categorized into five age groups: 0-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20 and 21-25 years after planting. The basic sampling design will comprise a 200x200m square grid transect with intersecting lines at every 50m interval that divide the grid into a further 16 parts. The transect will be established at least 1km from the borders of each site (one stand-age block), to avoid edge effects.
Five unbaited pitfall traps (50ml falcon tubes) will be randomly installed around each of 6 random intersection points of the grid transect, at least 10m apart from each other. Ants collected will be stored in vials of 80% ethanol and taken to the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge for
identification to morphospecies level.Environmental parameters such as canopy cover, temperature and relative humidity, will also be recorded daily over the entire sampling period, using non-invasive and portable instruments at each
sampling point. Vegetation and epiphyte covers will be visually estimated. Only samples from oil palm blocks of age range 6-12 years will used for analysis of beta diversity. Geographical coordinates of the central point of each grid will be recorded and used for calculation of spatial distances between separate sites. Distances between sampling sites must be at least 1km; hence the need to use 4th order SAFE sites separated by 1.78km intervals. Old growth (primary) forest sites will be sampled with the same procedure used at plantation sites and similarly analysed for beta diversity.

"SAFE-PRJ-57","Composition of butterfly communities","butterfly2-safe-110x110.jpg","ob269@cam.ac.uk","Rainforest butterflies are considered as suitable indicators of human
disturbance since they are usually gradually replaced by species that are
adapted to invade disturbed areas. Most true forest butterflies are very
sensitive to high temperatures and will not survive if exposed to direct
sunlight and drier conditions for prolonged periods of time.This means that butterflies should have difficulties recolonising fragmented
forest areas regenerating after previous degradation, or to re-establish in
isolated but suitable habitats after local extinctions. They are considered as valuable biological early warning signals of disturbances that can be hard to detect using other methods.Many other groups of animals and plants that are used for biomonitoring have longer lifespan, meaning that they can still persist as adults in a habitat which is no longer suitable for reproduction, making disturbances harder to detect in an early stage.
Butterflies also have an advantage as indicator since they are reasonably well documented compared to many other insects making field identification of most species possible. We are interested in studying the species composition among butterfly communities in the different habitats and fragments within the SAFE project to get quantitative measurements of how the environmental changes affect the butterfly diversity. We plan to do an initial survey of butterflies in all the four main habitat types at two different seasons and if possible repeat the survey in coming years to follow changes in the fragmented areas compared to the continuous habitats.
By using a standardized trapping technique the survey should be possible to be run by other researchers or to be expanded or repeated in other areas within the project.","Many adult rainforest butterflies feed on fallen fruit or carrion. These groups of butterflies are easily caught in standard cylindrical traps baited with fermented banana and rotten fish. The baited traps do not use poison, making the sampling as non-invasive as possible and also makes it possible to tag butterflies to avoid recounting the same individual. Hand netting and visual observations will complement the bait trapping to build up a more complete species list. Bait trapping is the most reliable method to get a quantitative measure of species abundance, and hence will
form the basis for comparison across sites, while the other methods will help to add species to a more qualitatively aimed species list to follow long term changes in species composition. In the initial survey we plan to trap for three continuous days in each of the four main habitat types (OG/OP/LF/Fragment C&E). Since many species are crepuscular, and possibly even nocturnal, it will be more efficient to leave traps out
for several days at the same site than to move between sites every given day. The traps will be placed within the second order framework of the experimental design. As far as possible species will be determined in the field and released after identification, while species requiring more detailed examination will be have to be retained for closer examination.","2011-11-10","2012-04-30",TRUE,TRUE,"",52,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|"
"SAFE-PRJ-58","Mammalian community structure and dynamics across spatio‐temporal gradients of land use intensity in Malaysian Borneo","4-150x150.jpg","oliver.wearn08@imperial.ac.uk","Given the rapid rates of forest loss, degradation and fragmentation in Southeast Asia, as well as the ongoing expansion of the palm oil industry (growing at an annual rate of nearly 7% in Malaysia), a) what are the prospects for mammalian communities and b) what might be the wider implications for forest ecosystem functioning?In order to fully address these timely questions, this project will take a whole‐community approach, since it is only at this level that the 'emergent' effects of landscape change (e.g. alterations in trophic structure and dynamics) can be assessed. However, this has rarely been done; the focus has usually been on single‐species dynamics, on species within one ecological guild, or on some univariate index of biodiversity (such as species richness). Mammalian responses to land‐use change, particularly from a community‐level perspective, remain poorly characterised outside the Neotropics, despite the considerable conservation attention given to mammals and their importance to ecosystems as major herbivores, top predators, seed dispersers and seed predators. That this research gap remains is perhaps unsurprising, given the immense difficulties in studying a taxon comprised mostly of rare and highly mobile species. To circumvent these difficulties and successfully sample mammalian communities, this project will use networks of remotely‐operated digital cameras. The photographic capture data that will be generated will enable the assessment of changes in mammalian community composition and dynamics across land‐uses, as well as changes in absolute density, space use and activity patterns. Camera‐trapping will be supplemented by traditional live‐trapping methods for those smaller species that cannot be captured photographically. The wider ecosystem effects of mammalian community change - in particular the effects on tree recruitment dynamics - will be assessed by seed removal and seedling herbivory trials in experimental plots. In addition to taking a whole‐community approach, this project is unique in studying the land‐use change and fragmentation process in real time. As part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) project, mammalian responses to the establishment of an oil palm plantation will be assessed, with data collection beginning one year before any habitat loss or fragmentation takes place and continuing for one year post‐establishment. This will be complemented by a mensurative study of the effects of land‐use change in the surrounding area, by sampling mammalian communities in primary forest, logged forest and mature oil palm. Incidentally, the primary forest site will be the remote and little‐known Maliau Basin Conservation Area, which has never been comprehensively surveyed with respect to mammals. Given the long time‐frame of the study, as well as the breadth of taxa that will be sampled, this project will be uniquely placed to offer a comprehensive, detailed and defensible account of the effects of land‐use change on mammalian communities, which will be of immediate interest to oil palm and logging concession managers, conservation practitioners, policy‐makers and other stakeholders in the region. In particular, the project will strategically address gaps in our knowledge of: 1) species' conservation status, 2) the impacts of logging and oil palm plantations (and how best to mitigate these impacts), 3) the wider ecosystem effects of changes in mammalian community structure, and 4) the role of key protected areas (i.e. Maliau Basin Conservation Area), conservation set‐aside (within oil palm plantations) and Virgin Jungle Reserves (VJRs) in the conservation of mammals. Ultimately, the results of this project will have direct implications for conservation and sustainable‐use practices in Borneo and, more broadly, in Southeast Asia.","Field work will be carried out in the Malaysian state of Sabah, over 2 full years. The project will be based at the SAFE Project experimental landscape and the Maliau Basin Conservation Area.
Mammalian communities will be sampled in a number of ways. The core of the project will involve the use of indirect, photographic capture techniques, in order to sample the majority of the large, cryptic mammalian species. This will be bolstered with small‐mammal cage trapping, as well as distance‐sampling of three key arboreal primates. In this way, all of the principal mammalian predators, herbivores, seed dispersers and granivores will be encompassed in the sampling protocols. These sampling methods will be employed across land‐use gradients in space (in primary, logged and fragmented forest) and in time (in continuous logged forest and, post‐conversion, in oil palm matrix habitat and the forest fragments that remain). To obtain estimates of species density, newly‐developed models of animal space use with respect to traps will be used, as well as conventional mark‐recapture statistics. To begin to assess the implications of mammalian community change across land‐use gradients, seed removal and seedling herbivory trials will be conducted for dominant tree species. The unique design of the SAFE project will also allow the integration of temporally and spatially coincident datasets on other ecosystem properties. Especially pertinent, will be those for tree communities and for below‐ground decomposer communities.","2010-09-15","2012-09-15",TRUE,TRUE,"",19,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|Policy|"
"SAFE-PRJ-59","Detecting change in small mammal community structure in logged tropical forests","Callosciurus-prevostii-150x150.jpg","jeremy.cusack09@imperial.ac.uk","Tropical forests in Malaysian Borneo, and the biodiversity they harbour, are under intense pressure from changes brought about by human land-use (Sodhi et al. 2004). Logging and conversion to oil palm plantations result in fragmentation and loss of key ecological features (e.g. large valuable trees), which have important consequences for the composition and structure of natural ecosystems.Given the current forest conversion rates (e.g. deforestation rates are around 1.5% per year in South East Asia; oil palm plantations are growing at an annual rate of 7% in Malaysia) it has become increasingly important to monitor the various components of biodiversity in order to detect the impacts of land-use at different levels and processes. Not only can these observations play a key role in informing sustainable use and recommending best practice for future forest exploitation, but they can also help devise efficient biodiversity monitoring programmes. As well as being important prey items, small mammals (e.g. Muridae and Tupaiidae) play major roles as seed dispersers and seed predators within tropical forests (Wells et al. 2007). Changes in small mammal community structure as a result of land-use are therefore predicted to have a direct impact on ecosystem processes and functions, making it essential that we detect these reliably and accurately, whilst maximising cost-effectiveness.Despite this, it has remained notoriously difficult to detect change in small mammal community structure owing to a number of natural (e.g. the patchiness of small mammal distributions within heterogeneous habitat, their characteristic resilience to disturbance, etc) and sampling factors (e.g. insufficient sampling effort, scale-related biases, etc) (Gardner et al. 2008).In this project, I will estimate and compare abundance of small mammals within and between continuous patches of logged and unlogged tropical forest using three different types of data (relative abundance, absolute abundance and occupancy) collected from two different sampling methods (trapping grids and lines transects). Additional information relating to species richness will also be collected. Together, these measures will help characterise small mammal communities within logged and unlogged tropical forests, with the ultimate aim of comparing the two. This comparative analysis should offer preliminary insights into how logging affects small mammal communities and lead to recommendations for future sampling (e.g. which is the best way to measure relative and absolute abundance and how much sampling effort is necessary). The usefulness of small mammals as an indicator taxon will be explored in light of my results.The outcomes of this project will be used to inform and recommend future trapping studies interested in evaluating the impact of land-use change on small mammal community structure. It will also provide additional empirical evidence in support for the most reliable methods of estimating abundance. This will have important consequences for the cost-effectiveness of future studies looking at small mammal community structure in logged tropical forests.","This project will focus on small non-volant mammals, which form an important research component of the SAFE project (see www.safeproject.net). The sampling method used in this project will involve live trapping and release for capture-mark-recapture analysis. Traps will be arranged into grids within logged and unlogged plots of forest of varying size (100 and 1ha plots), the latter forming six spatially distinct but structurally similar plot assemblages. This multi-tiered nested design establishes four sampling scales (individual sampling point, individual grid, individual plot assemblage and land-use type). The hierarchical sampling protocol will be based on the established SAFE design, which uses a fractal pattern explicitly designed to allow for the unification of data from ecological patterns and processes that operate at different scales.
Trapping grids will be used to estimate absolute abundance and occupancy of small mammals. Additional line transects will also be set up in both habitats in order to obtain measures of relative abundance. Importantly, sampling in logged forests will take place before the start of any planned clearance. Data for unlogged habitats will be collected from the nearby Maliau Basin Conservation Area by Oliver Wearn (i.e. I will not collect these data personally). The sampling design used to collect these data will be similar to that used for logged forests, thus enabling comparison between the two.Collected data will be used to derive the following:1. Comparisons between relative and absolute abundance measures between different land-uses.2. Measures of abundance from presence-absence (occupancy) data and an assessment of their usefulness and reliability through comparison with measures of relative and absolute abundance.3. Species abundance distribution graphs - these will provide valuable
information on the composition of small mammal communities (e.g. common and rare species) and how it varies across sampling sites and between land-uses. Models will be fitted to these distributions in order to facilitate description and comparison (Magurran 2004, 2011).4. Species accumulation and sample-based rarefaction curves - from these, a specific minimum amount of sampling effort (in terms of number of individuals or samples collected) could be determined for which the confidence intervals of the two curves cease to overlap (Gotelli and Colwell 2001, Wells et al. 2007).Alternatively, the use of recently developed non-parametric estimators could be used to estimate the asymptote of such curves and help further comparison (Chao et al. 2005, Magurran 2011).*Note: Specific environmental and spatial variables at different scales will be recorded. This will involve data collection in the field (e.g. canopy cover, density of understory, etc), which will be complemented with data from GIS databases of microclimate and ecosystem processes (collected by the SAFE project and provided by Rob Ewers). These will/could be used as covariates in statistical analyses.","2012-04-30","2012-07-10",TRUE,TRUE,"",31,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-6","Land use change and species invasion: synergistic effects of multiple drivers of global change on species interactions","land-safe-110x110.jpg","timm.dobert@csiro.au","Biological invasions are major drivers of global change (MEA 2005). Non-nativespecies potentially cause considerable environmental and social change withassociated negative economic impacts (Didham et al. 2007). For the purpose of thisresearch, non-native plant species are defined as those that were not native to theSAFE area prior to human intervention and whose presence is attributable to humanactions. The negative impacts of non-native species on native biota are increasinglyfound across ecosystems (Pysek & Richardson 2010), yet little is known about howthese effects might vary in the context of other drivers of global change (Peh 2010).Our research will investigate the direct and indirect consequences of landscapemodification and non-native plant invasions on ecosystem processes and biodiversityacross the increasingly blurred interface of managed landscapes and natural forestfragments. The following objectives will be covered during the PhD candidature ofTimm DÃ¶bert within a larger research programme to be expanded by Prof Didhamand Assoc Prof Webber until 2020: i. To conduct a comprehensive survey of thecurrent spatial distributions of native and non-native plant species from local tolandscape scales, and establish permanent plots to monitor invasion dynamics overthe life span of oil palm plantation conversion at SAFE; ii. To test the relativedeterminants of plant species presence and abundance under differing landscapecontexts (including mechanisms such as propagule pressure, recruitment processes,abiotic filtering, and competitive dynamics) for selected non-native species; iii. Toquantify the synergistic impacts of land-use change and species invasion onplant-insect interactions (such as herbivory or pollination) for selected native andnon-native plant species; iv. To elucidate the links between oil palm plantations andnon-native species (i.e. identify introduction pathways) to generate guidelines forimproved oil palm management policies that facilitate sustainable agriculturalpractices to the benefit of native biodiversity.","The following methodological elements will be undertaken during Phase 1 of the study: i. Changes in Plant Species Distribution To date, little is known about the general distribution and impacts of non-native plant species on native biodiversity or ecosystem processes in Sabah. To fill this significant research gap, we will conduct a comprehensive baseline survey of non-native plant species at systematic locations throughout the SAFE landscape. Edge gradient transects will be established at each of the six experimental landscape blocks (A - F), as well as at “dummy” 1ha, 10ha and 100ha fragments within logged forest (LF), old growth forest (OG), and mature oil palm control plots (OP). Sampling plots will be established on both the “matrix” and “patch” sides of the forest edge. At each sampling distance, five plots will be established and randomly assigned to one of five treatments. Two treatments will be conducted prior to forest clearing to establish baseline pre-deforestation plant species composition and relative abundance data. ii. Plant Species Presence and Absence The experimental manipulations in the other three plots will commence after logging and will be comprised of a soil manipulation plot to test for abiotic/disturbance filters on non-native plant establishment and a non-native weeding and native weeding plot, respectively, to investigate plant species re-assembly and biotic resistance. Hand-clipping of weeds with targeted application of herbicide where necessary will be used for both native and non-native removal experiments. Comment: It is important to note that no experimental manipulations will involve the purposeful introduction of non-native plant propagules into the SAFE sites (only natural colonisation processes are being measured). iii. Insect-Plant Interaction Networks The effects of landscape change and plant species invasion on insect-plant interaction networks will be investigated in the later stages of the PhD, following the baseline surveys. In brief, we will build quantitative plant-herbivore interaction webs for invaded and non-invaded plant communities. Potential multi-trophic interactions with natural enemies might also be explored for selected non-native plant species. Standardized insect sampling techniques will be used, such as vacuum sampling, sweep netting and hand collection. iv. Invasion Pathways and Management Guidelines Humans can play a significant role as vectors for non-native plants in modified landscapes. This component of the research project will identify potential vectors specific to the oil palm plantation industry. The methods for defining oil palm plantation management guidelines will be developed according to the outcomes of the above aims and further discussion with plantation managers and the SAFE management team.

Since this trend is likely to continue in the foreseeable future here, it appears that in the long run the survival of many tropical forest faunas in Sabah may depend more heavily on the management of derived habitats on a landscape scale that includes some natural
forests and degraded forest fragments within large converted habitat matrix.The primary reason for the proposed study is to increase the information available on how primates respond to changes to their native habitats due to anthropogenic activities with the hope to improve the conservation management of these animals in a mosaic landscape of natural, altered and fragmented habitats. There has been no long-term study on Malaysian primates, at the community level, that addresses the question on how does forest fragmentation, isolation and conversion affect the number of species present and their distribution over time. The present study aims to investigate the changes in the distribution patterns and persistence of primate species in continuous forest habitats at three different stages i.e. prior to, during and after the process of fragmentation and isolation, as well as within the large converted habitat matrix of oil palm plantations.","This study will utilise the experimental design and areas offered by the SAFE project site. Using the existing trail system in the study area, primate census will be conducted in the continuous forest habitats to collect baseline data prior to the fragmentation of the forest. Subsequent censuses will be conducted during the fragmentation process and after the fragmentation and isolation of the forest fragments. Similar census will be conducted in the oil palm habitat. Censuses will be continued for at least three years in all continuous forest habitats, the forest fragments and oil palm. Censuses will be conducted in four equally spaced cycles each year in order to account for annual and seasonal fluctuations in primate presence and resource abundance.During the census all available trails will be walked, stopping at every 50m to look and listen for primates. Censuses will be carried out during the day and night time to detect the presence of diurnal and nocturnal primates. Upon locating a primate individual or group the following information will be recorded: (1) species, (2)number of individual seen (group size), (3) group composition by sex and age (adult, juvenile, and infant), (4) GPS location, (5) time of sighting, (6) animal to observer distance, (7) height of the individuals from the ground, and (8) activity of the individuals. In order to account for seasonal changes in young leaves production, fruit and flower abundance and density, phenological data of the vegetations representing the forest fragments and continuous forest will be collected during each of the census cycle.To explain the detected differences in primates distribution and persistence in the continuous forest and forest fragments, several parameters will be considered including the fragment size and degree of isolation (from the large continuous forest, as well as in relation to other fragments), the habitat quality by evaluating the composition and vegetation structure including tree canopy continuity and tree DBH and the quality of the matrix habitats around the periphery of each of the forest fragment. Other resources that may be important for primates, including the abundance of insect and non-insect invertebrates will be acquired from other independent research projects that are carried out parallel to this project. Data analysis on the effects of the different parameters will take into account the individual primate species-specific habitat requirements.","2012-02-01","2014-12-31",TRUE,TRUE,"",20,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|NA|"

After clearance of contiguous areas of degraded forest, what is left behind is a matrix of oil palm cultivation and fragments of (degraded) forest. This study will investigate the cost of conversion of degraded forest to plantations. It will then focus on the effect of forest fragmentation on biodiversity, and seek to understand the attributes that determine the extinction risk of species to fragmentation, by comparing those species that are lost versus retained within fragments. Finally, this work will quantify any secondary biodiversity benefits of forest fragments, including (i) the export of pest-control agents from forest to oil palm and (ii) the retention of landscape connectivity.

"SAFE-PRJ-62","Effects of riparian border size and land use change on tropical amphibians","frog2-safe-110x110.jpg","jasheridan@gmail.com","The greatest threat to amphibians today is habitat loss. Currently, Southeast Asia has the highest rate of deforestation in the world, and one of the highest rates of new anuran species description. Thus, SE Asian amphibians are at risk of going extinct before they are even described or their ecology and behavior understood. Much of the deforestation in the region is due to conversion to oil palm, and little is known about how this conversion affects ecologically sensitive species such as amphibians. As part of the SAFE project, I aim to examine changes in anuran ecology associated with conversion of forest to oil palm. There are three main goals of this research.1. Quantify the relationship between riparian border size and change in abundance and diversity. Nocturnal stream surveys will identify abundance and diversity of adult anurans on each stream. I will use these data to determine 1) the rate of change in abundance and diversity due to forest conversion, 2) the effects of riparian border size on abundance and diversity changes, and, utilizing hydrology and net primary productivity data collected by other SAFE researchers, 3) the strongest predictors (dissolved oxygen, sedimentation, net primary productivity) of changes in abundance and diversity of frogs.2. Determine the persistence of source populations by examining presence/absence of tadpoles. Surveys of tadpoles will determine which species seen on the streams as adults are actually breeding in those streams (source populations) and which species are not likely utilizing the streams to breed (sink populations). After forest conversion, I will continue to monitor tadpole abundance and diversity to determine the relationship between persistence time as a source population and a) forest conversion and b) riparian border size. Additionally, utilizing hydrology data such as dissolved oxygen and sedimentation, I can determine the ultimate factors responsible for any observed losses of tadpole populations.
3. Examine changes in advertisement calls as related to riparian border size, and how that in turn affects mate choice and reproductive success. Studies from other areas have shown that frogs alter calls in response to habitat alteration, and this can affect mate choice and reproductive success. Recording calls before and after the clearing, I can determine how habitat alteration affects call parameters such as dominant frequency and call rate. Changes in these parameters normally convey information on the fitness of the male, but few studies have shown how these factors may shift with change in the acoustic environment, and what the consequences of such shifts might be for reproductive success.","I will establish 400 m transects along the six experimental watersheds, and along two control streams, one in the virgin jungle reserve, and one in previously logged forest that will not be cleared for oil palm. Transects will be surveyed 6-7 times each over a two-month period prior to clearing. I will collect voucher specimens of each species on each stream (up to 5 individuals per species per stream) along with tissue samples for future DNA work to examine changes in population genetics.Each stream will also be surveyed for tadpoles prior to clearing. I will use electroshocking methods to survey tadpoles at the bottom, middle, and top of each transect. To insure that these methods do not affect our observations of frogs on night surveys, I will survey tadpoles in each stream the morning after its night survey, giving us the maximum amount of time between diurnal tadpole surveys and the subsequent nocturnal adult surveys. Tadpole surveys will identify species that are breeding on the stream, and species which are observed as adults but are not likely breeding. Effectively, this allows us to identify source and sink populations so that I can quantify the rate of shift from source to sink after conversion to oil palm. I can also correlate changes in tadpole abundance and diversity with changes in abiotic factors such as dissolved oxygen and sedimentation.I will also record advertisement calls of anurans in order to determine how anthropogenic noise and shifts in habitat (from dense primary or secondary forest to oil palm) affect frog calls. Up to ten individuals per species on each stream will be recorded prior to clearing in order to establish baseline call parameters. During and following clearing, I will record calls to determine how the calls shift in response to anthropogenic noise and altered habitat structure.
After the clearing, I will continue to monitor abundance and diversity of adults and tadpoles, and record advertisement calls. My aim is to continue the project for multiple years in order to look at changes in anuran ecology in response to habitat alteration. I am currently pursuing funding that would allow me to pay several research assistants to help with the long-term monitoring, and I plan to spend several months of each year on site, as time and funding permits.","2011-05-01","2016-09-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",10,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Freshwater Biology|Agriculture|Riparian|"

The intermediate-disturbance-hypothesis, whereby we envisage young oil palm plantations to hostthe most depauperate assemblages, and large areas of recovering logged forests to host assemblageswith high levels of diversity.2). The hypothesis that large fragments and wide riparian corridors host more species and individualsat a standard sampling effort than small fragments and narrow riparian corridors.","Bat surveys will be undertaken in replicates of each of the main habitat/management types: old growthforest, logged forest, young-growth (ca 5 yr) oil palm plantation, old-growth (>15 yr) oil palmplantation, as well as forest fragments and riparian strips of various sizes.Priority will initially be given to sampling at the fragment sites prior to clearance to oil palm, April toJuly 2011. A minimum of 3 pre-fragments in each block will be surveyed (minimum total: 6x100ha; 6x10ha; 6x1ha), depending largely on availability of trapping positions across open access trails. Initially,it is likely that sampling will be stratified according to the number of trails available - previous work inWest Malaysia (Struebig et al 2008, 2009) indicates that ca 15 traps positions are available in 'natural'100 ha fragments during a single survey. If this effort was available for all fragments, then samplingusing the following protocol would take 8-12 weeks for the 18 fragments. Some preliminary samplingin old-growth oil palm will also be undertaken during this time. Based on data acquired from pre-fragment areas and oil palm, a sampling regime will be designed for the other habitat/managementtreatments over subsequent years.Sampling methods are all prone to their own capture bias, so a suite of methods will be used tocapture bats:1. Harp traps will target insectivorous forest-specialist bats and will form the bulk of the sampling.Up to eight 'four-bank' traps will be set across access trails/transects and other flight pathssuch as logging skids and streams ca. 50-100 m apart, and moved to a position the followingday following a standardised protocol that I have successfully used elsewhere in Malaysia andIndonesia. Vegetation above and at the sides of traps acts to 'funnel' bats into the trap.
2. Mist-nets (70 denier nylon, three or four shelves, 36 mm mesh size) will be used to guide batsinto traps in open plantation habitat and will also be set in the understory and midstory at allsites to target fruit bats.
3. Acoustic monitoring will be used to further sample echolocating bats that can avoid harp trapsand/or fly above the forest understorey.
All bats will be identified by external features and measurements on site, and a tissue sample will betaken from the right wing using a 3mm biopsy punch. Tissue samples (maximum: 20-30 individuals perspecies) will be retained in 90% ethanol for future population genetic studies in collaboration with alocal counterpart. Using wing biopsies also serves as a short-term mark-recapture method allowingrecaptured bats to be reliably removed from assemblage analyses where appropriate. Bats areunharmed by the procedure and will be released at the capture point within 12 hours.
Rarefaction, as well as generalised linear and generalised linear mixed effects models, will be used tocompare levels of species diversity and abundance between sites and habitat/managementtreatments. Ordination techniques (e.g. NMS, PCA) will be used to explore variation in assemblagestructure between sites/treatments and joint-plots with species abundances and environmentalvariables will be used to determine the main factors associated with this variation.

In addition, data will form a baseline pre-fragmentation data set of ant and termite diversity and abundance, which will be useful for comparison with future research.","Replicate 4m x 4m quadrats will be marked out, one at each of the SAFE project 2ndorder points in old growth forest, secondary forest and oil palm control sites, and the experimental area.

All dead wood items encountered from ground level up to a height of 2m within each section will also be sampled for termites and ants. For each separate encounter with termites and/or ants, soldiers and workers will be sampled in the case of termites, just workers in the case of ants, and these will be stored in vials of ethanol to preserve them for later identification. Relative species abundance will be assessed by recording the number of separate encounters, or 'hit rate' at each survey point (after Davies et al. 2003). Habitat features including canopy cover, tree size, leaf litter depth, abundance of dead wood, grass etc., will be measured at each locality sampled for termites and ants. Specimens will be identified to species level under the guidance of Dr Paul Eggleton and Dr Tom Fayle of the Natural History Museum, London. Ordination analyses will be conducted to investigate variation in assemblages across habitat types and the role of environmental variables in determining community structure, whilst randomisation analyses will be used to test for non-random occurrences of ant and termite species that may indicate interactions.

However, particularly in the tropics this situation is severe. Apart from the various threats to amphibian species, their functional role in the complex tropical ecosystems and many crucial ecological relationships are likely to be modified by a shifting species assemblage as well. Although only very few studies address the ecological role of an entire taxonomical group, functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, identifying the effects of logging and land conversion on different aspects of biodiversity and general ecosystem properties is of prime importance for the understanding of altered forest ecosystems. Commonly used measures of biodiversity may only inadequately reflect actual disturbance after logging.The high species diversity and the relatively high abundance of amphibians in many tropical ecosystems may implicate an important role in ecosystem functioning. In Borneo anurans are the dominant terrestrial vertebrate group in riparian habitats and many other areas with water bodies suitable for breeding, such as stagnant ponds and phytotelmata. Our aim is to investigate whether this high alpha species diversity and high number of individuals also reflect the ecological importance of amphibian assemblages as well to assess how this ecological role shifts along a gradient of habitat disturbance.","We will gather data for the morphological diversity of anuran assemblages and we will sample the anurans´ diet by stomach flushing and feces samples.

Stomach flushing of adult anurans has been fieldtested before and recent scientific publications propose this method as an effective way of assessing anuran diets. To investigate the diet of very small anurans we will collect feces samples by keeping the individuals in small boxes for some hours until they defecate.

By using a combination of standard cotton squares and litter bags containing leaf litter collected in each focal area, this project will compare both standardised and actual decomposition rates across sites. In particular this project will address the following questions: 1)Does the rate of litter decomposition vary across a habitat degradation gradient from primary forest to logged forest and oil palm plantation? 2)Is any recorded change in decomposition rates related to the identity of litter found in the different habitat types? 3)How is the rate of litter decomposition in the different sites related to other environmental and biological factors collected in the same areas (including temperature and humidity, vegetation structure, and insect community identity)? 4)Does the rate of litter decomposition change with forest fragmentation and conversion to oil palm plantation? ","Litter collection leaf litter will be collected across a network of 193 1m2 leaf litter collection traps, set up in the centre of each vegetation plot as part of the core SAFE project (see Above-ground net primary productivity and Herbivory rates in modified forests proposals for more details). Each trap will be cleared and left for approximately 15 days to collect freshly-fallen leaf litter. All complete leaves collected will be separated from other litter, oven dried, and cut into approximately 2cm pieces. These collections will then be pooled (with large veins and petioles being excluded) for each fragment (A-F) or area in control habitats (OG1, OG2 etc.). To allow for future analysis of nutrients etc, approx 20% of each leaf will be stored separately for each plot. In the oil palm control habitat very little leaf litter is collected in traps and most ground leaf litter originates from fronds cut from living trees during palm harvest. To replicate this, leaf litter for the oil palm control habitats was obtained by selecting one tree per vegetation plot at random and cutting and drying the largest frond. The leaflets from this dried frond were then prepared in the same way as leaf litter in the other habitats. Litter bag and cotton square preparation - All leaf samples will be oven dried before being weighed into 4 gram samples and placed into 10cm2 litter bags with a mesh size of 2 by 3mm. Sufficient cotton squares (100% cotton)of 10 by 10cm will also be cut and weighed for each site. As the weight of each cotton square varies slightly, each will be given an individual tag and its initial weight recorded. Each plot will then be allocated 2-4 (depending on availability) bags of leaf litter and five cotton squares at random. Each set of five cotton squares and litter bags for each site will be tied together with fishing twine, to ease relocation in the field. Setting and collection â€“ Litter bags and cotton squares will be placed in the field at the centre of each vegetation plot.

Where insufficient litter was available for four bags, collections will be preferentially taken on the first and last litter collections. Processing â€“ Collected leaf litter and cotton samples will be oven dried directly to stop further decomposition. Any soil on the samples will then be gently brushed off and the samples weighed to assess rates of mass loss (decomposition) over time. Litter decomposition measurements will be taken across all sites directly before clearance is scheduled to start in the experimental area, and then again directly after clearance has finished and at regular intervals over the course of the project.

Effects of past erosion from pre-logging primary forest times to the present-day are stored in floodplain and lateral bench deposits of the rivers of the area. Changes in the rate of accumulation and the geochemical properties of the sediment down sediment cores obtained from such deposits can be used to indicate changes in the rates, sources and processes of upstream slope and stream erosion using a sediment fingerprinting and radioisotope dating approach.

"SAFE-PRJ-79","Epiphytes in palm plantations: diversity and pest control","orchid-epiphyte-safe-110x110.jpg","grahamprescott@gmail.com","One of the greatest challenges of the 21st century is to feed a global population increasing in both numbers and affluence, whilst halting the loss of biodiversity. Agricultural landscapes now occupy approximately 40% of the world's ice-free land surface (Foley et al. 2005) and this figure is expected to continue to increase. Effective conservation of the world's biodiversity will require the preservation of natural habitat, but will also require measures to promote biodiversity on agricultural landscapes. If these measures reduce yield, this may entail increased conversion of natural habitats - a trade-off which needs to be considered carefully (Green et al. 2005). However, it is generally thought that increased biodiversity is associated with benefits to ecosystem services (such as pollination and natural pest control), so in some cases promoting agricultural biodiversity may increase yield. While the link between biodiversity and ecosystem services is relatively well-supported theoretically (Hooper et al. 2005), few studies have shown this empirically in an agricultural system (Klein et al. 2003; Koh 2008).Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) represents a good model system in which to investigate links between biodiversity and ecosystem services. Its cultivation has expanded widely in Malaysia, which now produces around 40% of the world's oil palm (FAO 2008). Several studies have compared biodiversity between oil palm and forest, and have found that for most taxa it is much lower in the former (e.g. Turner & Foster 2009; Aratrakorn et al. 2006). The reasons for this loss of biodiversity are generally thought to involve the biological and structural simplification of the landscape and the changes in physical climate (Foster et al. 2011). This suggests that it should be possible to increase biodiversity within oil palm plantations by mitigating these changes.Epiphytes have been found to host a large amount of diversity within forest habitat (Ellwood & Foster 2004) - as well as increasing the biological and structural complexity, they can provide a cooler microclimate. Measures to promote the diversity of plant species in plantations could increase the diversity of arthropods and birds (e.g. understory vegetation in a Guatemalan oil palm plantation was experimentally shown to increase bird diversity - Nájera & Simonetti 2010). Both ants and birds have been linked to the control of herbivorous insects (e.g. Dejean et al. (1995) and Koh (2008) respectively), so increased ant and bird diversity within plantations could help control pest herbivory in plantations.
Pest herbivory, especially by lepidopteran larvae (Psychidae and Limacodidae) can be economically significant in plantations (Khoo et al. 1991; Corley & Tinker 2003) and managers have increasingly moved towards methods of biological control (Wood 2002). As epiphytes can be easily added or removed to trees, this system provides an excellent model in which to study the potential links between biodiversity (of epiphytes, ants and birds) and an ecosystem service (pest control).
Questions:
1. Does the presence of epiphytes affect bird and ant diversity within the plantation?
2. Does the presence of epiphytes affect ecosystem services such as pest control?","I am conducting large scale experiments in which I will remove all epiphytes from a four hectare plot while leaving an otherwise similar control area untouched. I will measure the diversity of epiphytes, birds and invertebrates (focusing on ants) and levels of natural pest control in experimental and control plots, just before clearance and two months afterwards.I will assess epiphyte diversity by censusing a sample of trees in each plot, bird diversity using point counts, and invertebrate diversity by canopy fogging.

"SAFE-PRJ-8","The impacts of tropical forest degradation and fragmentation on ant-plant mutualisms, and consequences for plant community dynamics","","dan.lestina@gmail.com","Ongoing anthropogenic habitat modification is resulting in new sets of species coming into contact with each other. These novel species interactions arise from the extinction of some species, new arrivals of others and changes in the abiotic environment. However, impacts of anthropogenic habitat modification on mutualistic species interaction networks have not been well quantified.Macaranga are widespread and common early succession trees, which provide shade for desirable late-succession trees. Mutualistic interactions between Macaranga trees and Crematogaster ants, aiding the trees in this role, are one of the most diverse in SE Asia. They therefore represent an ideal model system for study of interaction network dynamics in altered environment. The research focuses on six specific hypotheses: 1) Macaranga host tree communities change with habitat degradation and regeneration. 2) The Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction network is affected by habitat. 3) Protection of plants by ants from herbivores changes with habitat degradation. 4) The provision of food and living space by trees to ants in return for protection is affected by habitat degradation. 5) The specific arrangement of habitat fragments will determine which ant and plant populations can persist at larger scales in degraded landscapes. 6) This symbiotic interaction is important in regeneration of heavily logged forests, fragmented forest, and oil palm plantations.","1) We will collate data on the distribution of all Macaranga across the range of land-use types. We will analyse data based on these trees to determine community patterns in Macaranga composition in relation to disturbance and regeneration. We will also include a number of environmental covariates: air and soil temperature and humidity, canopy cover, vegetation structure, plant species composition, leaf litter depth, humus depth, litter volume, and dead wood density. We will also carry out parallel analyses on abundances of individual Macaranga species, to test the hypothesis that species involved in more generalist interactions should be more robust to habitat change. We will use multivariate methods to analyse how Macaranga species composition changes with disturbance. 2) To quantify shifts in Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction networks we will assess ant interactions with all Macaranga trees smaller than 5m in height in selected plots. We will analyse overall interaction network specificity metrics. These metrics will be used as response variables in a series of statistical analyses (as above). We will e.g. test whether the degree of specificity of Macaranga species in primary forest in terms of their ant symbionts predicts their vulnerability to habitat change. 3) Assays will be made for rates of ant patrolling and ant attacks on a model herbivore (termite worker). We will survey externally feeding herbivore communities on these trees by beating entire small trees, in order to test directly whether ant presence reduces herbivore numbers, communnity composition and biomass. In order to get measures of plant fitness, we will extract growth rate and flowering/fruiting data from the SAFE database for all trees > 1 cm DBH, allowing assessment of whether occupancy by different ant species differentially affects growth rates or reproduction for particular Macaranga species, whether this varies between Macaranga species, and whether these dependencies are altered by habitat change. 4) Macaranga provision of food bodies and extra floral nectar will be assessed following established methods. For the same species pairs, but from individuals outside of our monitoring plots, we will make collections of scale insects (Coccus spp.) tended by the Crematogaster living inside Macaranga hollow stems, since plant feeding of ants may be mediated via sap-sucking insects. This will also allow the opportunity to assess plant provisioning of living space to ants. 5) We will first survey all selected Macaranga species at increasing distances into oil palm from a source population in logged. We will then explore the landscape-scale dynamics of this mutualistic interaction network by creating an individual-based metacommunity simulation model. Dispersal rates of ants and plants will be parameterised using fitted curves of dispersal along the transects. 6) We will conduct experimental ant removals (away from permanent SAFE/SBE plots) to see whether any reduced Macaranga viability from loss of ant protection decreases recruitment rates of shade-demanding dipterocarps. We will also conduct a series of transplants of three focal obligate myrmecophyte Macaranga species at increasing distances into continuous oil palm plantation. We predict that more isolated plants will be less likely to be colonized by ants.","2016-06-01","2019-12-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",NA,"|Plant Science|Zoology|Ecology|"

Objectives:
Objective 1: Collect data on carbon storage in riparian margins and compare with existing data from other land types.
Objective 2: Collect data on bird biodiversity and distribution in various land use types (including riparian margin).
Objective 3: Combine the above data with remote sensing and GIS data to build a spatial model of carbon storage and bird diversity and distribution.
Objective 4: Test and validate the spatial model with new field data collection
Objective 5: Create and explore a theoretical model of a designer tropical landscape that maximizes carbon storage and bird diversity within the given land use constraints.","Objective 1-Objective 4 form a part of the pre-planning stage to be undertaken before the field trip. They focus on creating a spatial model of the designer landscape (that can reconcile both biodiversity conservation and agricultural expansion). Remote sensing and secondary data (of birds distribution, land cover) has been used to identify suitable habitats for range restricted and endemic birds in the landscape. This coarse scale model further has been used to prioritize which land use types are critical for the persistence of birds under consideration. The spatial model will also focus on identifying the carbon storage and biodiversity conservation potential of the riparian margins by using a combination of remote sensing and secondary data. The purpose of these evaluations is two-fold. Firstly to identify the conservation potential of the riparian margins (both in terms of carbon storage and providing habitat to birds). Secondly, to identify which landscape elements such as presence of riparian margins, creation wildlife corridors can enable species persistence and dispersal once the present habitat is threatened by oil palm expansion.Field work will be carried out to validate and update the spatial model thus created.Objective 5: Validating the Model through Field ResearchCollection of Ground Data: Ground data will focus on collecting data to estimate the carbon storage potential of the riparian margins and the experiment catchments. In addition to these, the variation in bird species diversity will be evaluated across the land types under consideration, namely the virgin jungle reserve, palm oil plantations and the logged forests using the layout of fragments proposed in the SAFE project.
The purpose of carrying out rapid bird biodiversity assessments (Gregory et al., 2004) across different land use types is to evaluate the suitability of different land use types (especially disturbed land use types like logged forests) in providing a suitable habitat to range restricted and/or endemic birds. This biodiversity data in turn will be used to validate the habitat suitability model (that has been developed on the basis of secondary data pertaining to bird species).
In order to evaluate the carbon storage potential and biodiversity conservation potential of the riparian margins, field survey will be focussed on the 8 existing riparian margins(widths varying from approximately 20 m and 100m to either side of the reserve) and the 6 SAFE experiment catchments.
For the purpose of estimating the above ground biomass (ABG ), the DBH of the trees will be measured. Tree measurements will follow the protocols outlined in the RAINFOR methods of tree census (http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/projects/rainfor/pages/manuals_eng.html).The measured DBH will be substituted into suitable allometric equations to obtain the value of ABG. This in turn can be used to estimate the above ground carbon storage potential of the riparian margins and the catchments. Bird surveys focussing on the range restricted/endemic species covered as a part of the theoretical model will be carried out (Weilstara and Pieterse, 2009). This will help evaluate up to what extent the riparian margins can facilitate the persistence and dispersal of range restricted bird species and hence may act as a viable landscape level strategy when the present habitats of birds are encroached upon by oil palm plantations.
The rationale behind carrying out both carbon and biodiversity surveys in the riparian margins is that the presence of landscape elements (riparian margins among others) has a major impact on the biodiversity and carbon dynamics of the area. This data will be used to test and validate the spatial model that has been created in the pre-planning stage (before going to the field). This in turn forms the foundation of creating the theoretical model of a tropical designer that can maximize both carbon storage and bird diversity in the given land use constraints.","2011-07-15","2012-01-01",TRUE,TRUE,"",2,"|Biodiversity|Plant Science|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|Meterology and Atmospheric Science|Riparian|"

Global agricultural expansion including the rapid expansion of oil palm production in Malaysia poses one of the largest threats to fresh waters through pollution, changing inputs of terrestrial material, and flow alterations. Species losses and community changes after habitat conversion are relatively well documented in terrestrial taxa but impacts of habitat clearance on freshwater systems especially in the tropics are poorly understood. Invertebrates dominate freshwater ecosystems in terms of diversity abundance and functional importance. Macro invertebrates including insects crustaceans and molluscs play important roles in aquatic food webs as predators, prey and processors of organic material. Invertebrates show varying responses to habitat change and their use as bio-indicators for assessing ecosystem condition is relatively well developed. We need a greater understanding of the taxonomy of stream biota, its role in stream ecosystem function, and knowledge of the impacts of habitat change on freshwater systems. Given the threats to freshwater systems we also need research that will aid conservation. In Malaysia there is a specific need to research the impacts of oil palm agriculture on freshwater systems and the threat posed by pollutants, including inputs of palm oil mill effluent (POME), fertilisers and pesticides. In my research I aim to: Investigate the diversity and function of macro invertebrate communities in rainforest streams and how these relate to environmental variables; Determine effects of forest clearance and oil palm agriculture on macro invertebrate community assemblages and functionality of streams; Test the effectiveness of conservation strategies including riparian buffer strips and POME processing in mitigating the impacts of habitat change on stream communities and develop (i) bio-indicators and (ii) models to assess.","Question 1: Pre - logging surveys will be conducted along comparable m transects at SAFE streams and at additional stream sites nearby. Assemblages will be sampled and specimens taken and identified later in the laboratory. Surveys of benthic macroinvertebrates using a Surber sampler will be taken at m intervals whilst surface insects will be sampled using hand nets along alternate m transects. Adult Odonata will be sampled along a m transect using butterfly nets and large macroinvertebrates (shrimps snails crabs) will be caught in baited bottle traps laid every m .Environmental data will be collected at m intervals (benthic and bottle trap survey points) and will include channel width, wetted width, depth, flow rate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and phosphate levels, pH, sediment size and depth, and canopy openness. Forest quality in riparian margins will be assessed in terms of canopy openness relascope reading and scales of forest quality and percentage liana cover. Ecosystem function will be investigated using litter bags stable isotope analysis and algal plates. Litter bags containing Macaranga spp leaves or cotton swatches and made of either a course (accessible to macroinvertebrates) or fine (inaccessible) mesh will be placed in rivers to decompose. Bags will be removed and contents weighed after m days. Specimens of plants (terrestrial and aquatic) and aquatic consumers (shrimps benthic invertebrates surface insects) will be collected for use in stable isotope analysis to allow food web structure to be calculated. Algal plates (plastic boards) will be deployed in streams to assess growth rate of algae and impact of macroinvertebrates on algal communities (using caged and non - caged repeats).
Question 2: Pre - logging diversity and function surveys at SAFE sites (listed above) will be repeated after surrounding forest has been logged and oil palm has been planted. Additional repeats will be completed at other stream sites to investigate effects of oil palm of different ages and variation in catchment habitat coverage as well as offering additional 'space - for - time' comparisons to support studies of real - time changes at SAFE streams. In addition questionnaires will be conducted in villages to assess the value of streams for local people and how provision of ecosystem services by streams is impacted by forest clearance and oil palm growth.
Question 3: Pre - and post - logging data will be compared across SAFE river sites to assess the role of riparian buffer strip width in mitigating the impacts of land use change. To assess impacts of POME diversity surveys and function experiments (likely to be a subset of the range of sampling done elsewhere) will be conducted up - and downstream of palm oil processing plants. If there are any sites that use different processing methods these will be assessed.

This leaves fragments of jungle reserves of various sizes to hold the remaining biodiversity. Unlike some studies (Aguirre & Dirzo 2008, ), studies on effects of fragmentation on organisms has always been on undetermined fixed area sizes, and these fragments are generally big in size relatively and on selected groups of organisms and plants. Fragmentation affects so many things in an ecosystem. This include insect abundance (Aguirre & Dirzo 2008) and plants (Albro et al. 2008). There are two of the most important mechanisms of change in fragmented communities which are area effects and edge effects. Area effects or isolation effects are ecological changes that occur as a result of fragment isolation, and are generally proportional in magnitude to fragment area. For example, small fragments tend to have small populations which suffer high rates of extinction due to random genetic and demographic events. Edge effects, however, are caused by gradients in physical and biotic factors near forest edges, and are generally proportional to the distance of the site from the nearest edge (Carvalho et al., 1999). As the conditions of the environment change, interactions of organisms also changes. Organisms may increase or reduce predation in order to fulfill their resource requirements.","1.

Yet despite studies of land-use change impacts on the biodiversity and biogeochemistry of tropical forests, the links between these impacts have received less attention: we still have a poor understanding of how human-driven changes in biodiversity feedback to alter biogeochemical processes. These uncertainties substantially restrict our ability to model and predict the response of tropical ecosystems to current and future environmental change.
The BALI consortium will address these knowledge gaps by launching a large-scale, replicated, and fully integrated study that brings together a multi-disciplinary team with the skills and expertise to study multiple taxonomic and trophic groups, different biogeochemical processes, and the complex interactions amongst them. Research will focus on trees and lianas, mycorrhizae, free-living soil microbes, and termites and ants, as these organisms are the principal agents for biogeochemical cycling in human-modified tropical forests. Quantification of these organisms' abundance, functional characteristics and activities will provide insights into the elemental cycles that they catalyse. The overall aims of the BALI consortium are to:
A1. Investigate how land-use change has altered the functional diversity of tropical forest ecosystems
A2. Evaluate the consequences of these changes in functional diversity for biogeochemical cycling and trace gas exchange
A3. Assess the regional consequences of forest alteration on biogeochemical cycling, trace gas exchange and atmospheric composition
The overarching goal of this workpackage is to quantify rates of biogeochemical cycling and biosphere-atmosphere exchange across the SAFE land-use gradient. Specifically, we will investigate:
1. Net primary productivity and plant-soil fluxes of Carbon and nutrients
2. Decomposition of plant tissues and soil organic matter
3. Soil fluxes of Carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorous
4. Canopy gas exchange and atmospheric composition
5. Soil microbial diversity and activity
The findings from this study will be used to address aims A2 and A3 described above. For example, data on pools and fluxes of C, N, P and trace gases, combined with metrics of functional diversity (the latter collected by other BALI consortium activities), will enable us to determine how the functional diversity of the biotic community is linked to biogeochemical processes (A2). Likewise, data on biogeochemical processes and their environmental drivers will allow us to scale-up from plot-level measurements to the region, as these data will be used to parameterise and drive process-based biogeochemical models (A3).","Field measurements and experiments will be conducted in 5 cover types that represent an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in Borneo, including old growth forest (OG), moderately logged forest (MLF), heavily logged forest (HLF), oil palm (OP) and rehabilitated forest (RF). Disturbance intensity progressively increases in a sequence from OG to MLF to HLF to OP. Our research will involve:
(i) Net primary productivity (NPP) and plant-soil fluxes of C and nutrients: Measurements of stem growth, leaf litter fall and fine root production are currently being collected as part of the existing core SAFE measurements or canopy flux measurements using eddy covariance. Fluxes of N, P and base cations (e.g. Ca, Mg) through the plant-soil system (inputs to soil from litterfall, plant nutrient uptake, plant nutrient translocation) will also be quantified by using stoichiometric data on leaves, wood, fine roots, litter and soil.
(ii) Decomposition: C, N and P fluxes from the plant litter to the soil will be determined by conducting decomposition experiments across the disturbance gradient using leaf litters of contrasting recalcitrance and model woody substrates of varying complexity. We will concomitantly collect data on potential drivers of decomposition. In addition, C and nutrient mineralisation will be quantified.
(iii) Decomposition: Soil fluxes of C, N and P will be collected. Soil CO2, CH4, NOx and N2O fluxes across the soil-atmosphere interface will be quantified over 2 years on a seasonal basis. Soil respiration (partitioned into root, mycorrhizal and heterotrophic components) will be measured. In addition, high frequency automated chamber measurements will be performed on a seasonal basis (wet, dry) to characterise the response of soil respiration and its components to temperature and moisture. The latter analyses will include measures of plant traits, litter and wood chemistry, soil N/P mineralization; and invertebrate community composition and activity (these are dealt in more detail in additional research proposals).
(iv) Canopy gas exchange and atmospheric composition: Background air and canopy gradient measurements of isoprene and BVOCs will be conducted. In addition, occasional air samples will be collected in tedlar bags and sent back to the UK for isotopic analysis.

Food webs and decomposition processes form a fundamental link between above- and belowground components of biodiversity and play a major role in many important ecosystem functions. Changes in the 'brown' food web involved in the decomposition of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients and carbon may in large part determine the functional consequences of biodiversity loss arising from forest degradation and fragmentation. Despite this, even relatively simple diversity effects on decomposition processes are unclear and interactions among plant diversity, invertebrate diversity and soil microbial communities represent a major knowledge gap in our understanding of ecosystem functioning, especially in highly diverse tropical forests.
This project aims to advance current knowledge of the links between biodiversity and function of the brown food web in tropical forests, with a particular focus on the impact of forest disturbance on biogeochemical cycling. A series of experiments will assess the impact of changes in aboveground functional diversity on soil microbial processes and determine the consequences for forest soil carbon dynamics and nutrient cycling, focussing on (i) plant litter, as a major input into soil food webs; (ii) litter invertebrates, which are a key part of litter processing chains, and (iii) microbial activity as a driver of soil carbon and nutrient cycling.

The experiments will manipulate the brown food web and examine the consequences for decomposer activity and biogeochemical processes along a forest modification gradient. Links between plant- and invertebrate functional diversity and the microbial processes underpinning ecosystem function will be examined with a suite of detailed measurements including soil CO2 efflux, decomposition rates, enzyme activity and soil and litter nutrients.
H1: Decomposition experiments using representative litter mixtures from sites across the modification gradient will explore the influence of plant diversity on decomposition processes, with a focus on testing trait complementarity in litter mixtures to assess the impact of functional species loss following forest disturbance.
H2: Reciprocal experiments across all sites will control for differences in soil properties and microclimate. Treatments using different litter mixtures and size-based exclusions of litter invertebrates will be applied in a factorial design to test for interactions.
As the project progresses, we will build on the results of these initial experiments to develop and test realistic extinction scenarios for tree- and invertebrate functional groups.

The objectives are characterising soil microbial communities and measuring associated biogeochemical fluxes. Little is known about trace gas fluxes (greenhouse gases (GHG) like CO2, CH4, N2O and bVOC) from soil and litter in tropical forests or about the links between GHG fluxes and microbial communities. These knowledge gaps make it difficult for developing countries in the tropics to develop mitigation strategies.
We therefore will measure CO2, CH4, N2O and bVOC fluxes from the mineral soil and organic horizons at habitat types ranging from intact logged forest to mature oil palm. This will allow assessment of the impact of logging and oil palm plantation on GHG emissions, and more accurate calculation of the GHG footprint of oil palm. We will investigate changes in the active soil microbial communities responsible for generating GHG fluxes along the gradient using next generation sequencing of the global metatranscriptomes in soil samples from the same plots.","Soil CO2, CH4, N2O & bVOC fluxes measurements from the five habitat types will be made as follows:
1) Monthly measurements of soil respiration rates in all plots for 3 years
2) Rhizosphere respiration rates from mesocosms with and without roots every 3 months for one year.
3) Soil N2O, CH4 & bVOC flux measurements every 2 months for 2 years in selected plots across the gradient.
4) Soil sampling for microbial community analysisSoil GHG fluxes will be measured using established chamber methods. To determine the effects of land use on the relative contributions of litter and soil organic matter to total soil respiration, measurements will be taken over mesocosms with normal litter inputs and additional soil collars from which the litter is removed each month. Fluxes of N2O, CH4 and bVOCs will be measured using small round PVC chambers placed on 40 cm diameter & 10 cm deep rings inserted into the soil for the 2 year measurement period. Samples are collected into vials and transported to the UK for analysis. At the same time soil samples will be collected for mineral N analysis at Sandakan Forest Research.
To link the active microbial communities with GHG production in WPA, soil samples (50 g/plot) will be taken at 2 month intervals for 2 years for community profiling after GHG sampling. For selected subset of locations soils (10 g/location) will be collected once for active microbial communities using next generation sequencing (Illumina HiSEQ) of the global metatranscriptomes . These samples need to be stored at -80 and transported to the UK for expert analysis by CEH and Aberdeen University.
The Malaysian Junior Collaborator (Melissa Melody Leduning) from University Malaysia Sabah will collect soil samples (approx 5 kg in total) from the study sites and will travel to the UK (CEH) to carry out a series of laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of changing environmental conditions on GHG and the ozone precursor nitric oxide.
The chamber method is not invasive; the shallow rings inserted into the ground for the two year study period have a minimal impact on the ecosystem. The chambers itself will only be placed onto the rings for 1-2 hour periods every two months. There will be 4 chambers per site
Small soil samples (2* 1 cm diameter 10 cm deep) will be collected close to each chamber on 12 occasions (every two months) in total for analysis at Forest Research, Sandakan; from this a small subsample will be taken for microbial analysis in the UK.

Linkages between above and below ground components of tropical biodiversity are likely to play a large role in determining the functional consequences of biodiversity changes arising from forest degradation and fragmentation.
We will investigate the extent to which predatory arboreal ants drive top-down trophic cascades linking the green and brown food webs, mediated via herbivorous insects. Arboreal ants are exceptionally abundant predators of insect herbivores, which in turn consume up to 40% of plant primary productivity often with significant impacts on plant fitness and ultimately community organisation. We will assess the strength of these cascades across the habitat modification gradient and determine their effect on ecosystem functioning. We will experimentally reduce the abundance and composition of arboreal ants. We predict that this will initiate a functional cascade, altering the herbivore-induced balance of inputs into the brown food web, with consequent effects on decomposition processes and biogeochemical cycles.","We will quantify and manipulate the green food web, across the modification gradient, focusing on arboreal ants and herbivorous insects.

The most basic aim is to evaluate the changes in biodiversity associated with modficiation of Borneo's tropical lowland forest and to relate these changes to ecological theory. While diversity changes in this system have previously been documented, experiments of the scale and number of repititions facilitated by the S.A.F.E. Project experimental design are lacking. Previous studies have also focused predominantly on alpha- (point diversity) and gamma-diversity (regional diversity), neglecting the important beta-component (difference in diversity between points).Insects are highly suitable for such an investigation because of their incredible taxonomic diversity (approximately 1.2 million described species) and unmatched resulting functional diversity. Within the class Insecta; beetles (order: Coleoptera), termites (order: Blattodea, infraorder: Isoptera) and ants (order: Hymenoptera, family: Formicidae) are selected for their own seperate analysis because of their high individual respective diversities.The diversity of insects in Borneo is a direct result of the environmental heterogeneity present in such a complex natural habitat, and so selective logging and conversion of forest to palm oil plantation is likely to impact strongly on insect community composition. The abundance of insects, coupled with the ease in which standardised trapping methods can be developed for catching them, renders the group an ideal subject for ecological analysis.
Questions to be answered:
(i) Does insect diversity change with conversion of tropical forest to palm oil plantation?
(ii) What are the spatial scales at which changes in community composition occur?
(iii) Does biomass correlate with diversity?","The traps set at each of the first-order points are assembled in the field and combine a pitfall, flight-interception and malaise trap. They consists of tall, narrow sections of acrylic held between two funnels, one acting as a pitfall and the other combined with netting to create a malaise-style design on top. The pitfall section of the trap is placed flush into the ground in a hole maintained between trapping sessions in order to minimise ground disturbance that might introduce bias to catch rates. Insects are forced either upwards into a “top” bottle or downwards into a “bottom” bottle, allowing capture of taxa with various morphology and behavioural responses. Both bottles are filled partially with 70%-ethanol solution.Traps are left open for three days before the samples are extracted from the collection bottles and moved into smaller containers for transport through sieving into fresh ethanol solution. All collected samples are labelled with first-order site number, block, date, top/bottom and the time of collection. Notes regarding each individual trap are also taken to ensure the exclusion of malfunctioned traps from later analysis. The traps are disassembled and removed after use. While it is logistically impossible to open or close all the traps at each of the first-order traps on the same day, they are set within a period of around one month to control for seasonality, with one trapping period in each of the wet and dry seasons each year.All samples are stored at Maliau Basin Studies Centre, where research assistants seperate trapped invertebrates from other debris. Specimens are seperated into beetles, termites, ants and “other” (everything else), and stored seperately in ethanol for further identification. Invertebrate biomass is estimated by placing all invertebrates with body length > 5 mm on blotting paper and weighing the blotted invertebrates. Counts of relative taxa are then used in the calculation of diversity indices.

"SAFE-PRJ-89","The impact of perceived predation risk on bird song along a logging gradient","Perceived-Predation-Risk-Songbirds-110x110.jpg","rajeev.pillay@ufl.edu","Human disturbances such as logging can alter several facets of animal behavior, which are not revealed in typical assessments of occurrence and abundance. For instance, bird song is a fundamental behavioral trait in mate choice and in the establishment and defense of territories, ultimately influencing sexual selection and individual fitness. Singing, however, is a conspicuous behavior that subjects songbirds to predation by raptors since it is often carried out from high perches to optimize signal transmission. The risk of predation, therefore, has the potential to influence singing behavior. The risk of predation may be a function of vegetation structural complexity or the availability and nature of protective vegetation cover. Logging alters vegetation structural complexity by reducing continuous canopy cover and increasing understory cover. These changes to vegetation cover may indirectly impact singing behavior. It is well known that song characteristics such as song rates, frequencies and temporal modulations have a major impact on mate choice. Changes in the way birds sing under heightened risk of predation (e.g. altered protective cover) can therefore hinder their ability to attract mates and defend territories. Such indirect costs of employing defensive behaviors to reduce mortality risk, i.e. the non-lethal effects of predation, would go unnoticed in assessments of occurrence and abundance and may eventually have significant negative effects on fitness and population dynamics. In the context of logging, no experimental work hitherto has tested how perceived predation risk influences songbird vocalizations and song characteristics.","I will manipulate predation risk via a playback experiment and simultaneously record the responses of song birds with SongMeter SM2+ GPS SongMeters (Wildlife Acoustics Inc., Concord, MA, USA). Microphone arrays, each comprising six stereo recorders will be set up in a pentagonal configuration with one SongMeter located at the center and five SongMeters at distances of 50 m from the central SongMeter. These microphone arrays will be centered at a first order sampling point (e.g. center of each 1ha fragment) and will enable the capturing of bird vocalizations emanating within an area of around 1 ha. This design will be replicated within the 100 ha fragments and at old growth control sites in the Maliau Basin. From April to August 2014, I will set up 16 arrays in different plots in logged forest and 12 arrays in unlogged old growth forest. This sampling period coincides with the breeding season for many passerine birds in Sabah. Each array will be deployed at each plot for five days and programmed to record songbird vocalizations for predetermined durations. A third of the plots in each forest type will be assigned to silent and procedural controls (e.g. local frog species). The procedural control will be used to test whether songbirds respond to all playbacks in a similar manner. For all plots that are assigned to the predator playback treatment, a silent control treatment will be used on Days 1 through 3 while experimental playbacks will be conducted on Days 4 through 5. Accipiter and owl calls will be played back on Days 4 through 5 using four directional loudspeakers linked to MP3 players. Each loudspeaker will be placed along randomly chosen radii of the pentagon at distances of 25 or 40 m (also randomly chosen) from the central SM2 and oriented to face the center of the array. Loudspeaker distances will be shifted on Day 5 and the order of playbacks reversed to minimize habituation. Predator calls will be played for 3 minutes followed by 27 minutes of silence. Thereafter, another loudspeaker at a different location within the array will play the calls of a second predator followed by another round of silence and so on. No calls will be played back in the silent control plots but aluminum trays moulded and painted to resemble the loudspeakers will be moved around in a similar manner to the speakers to mimic the activity of researchers when loudspeakers are set up in the predator treatment plots.

Fletcher ( ) found that the availability of suitable roosts in an undisturbed Malaysian forest influences the distribution of bat species and globally Findley ( ) found that roost availability affects both the geographical distribution of bats and the diversity of these communities In tropical areas primary forests or regenerated secondary forests can provide critical roosting habitat for bats ( Hutson et al ).

Four key problems have limited our ability to understand the effects of habitat loss. First, large-scale experiments on habitat loss remain exceptionally rare. As a result, our understanding of habitat loss has in some situations been limited and in others remarkably incorrect. Second, it is exceedingly difficult to monitor a wide-range of taxa with standardized and rigorous methodologies. Third, a fundamental process impeded by habitat loss - movement of organisms - is one of the most challenging processes to measure at relevant scales for several species. Fourth, a major focus of studies on habitat loss effects has been on changes in occurrence and abundance of taxa. However, disturbances such as habitat loss can alter several facets of animal behavior which are not revealed in typical assessments of occurrence and abundance. The lack of experimental work and difficulties in measuring key behavioral attributes means that several outstanding hypotheses regarding population processes and various aspects of animal behavior in the face of habitat loss remain poorly tested.I propose to use bioacoustic monitoring to (i) sample the avian community in a standardized manner, (ii) precisely measure bird locations through high resolution GPS triangulation of emitted sounds and, (iii) record sound variations of species in response to changing environments. I will use portable, wireless, microphone arrays (Wildlife Acoustics SongMeter SM2+) coupled to GPS units to enable time synchronization (average location accuracies of ±1.87 m) between different recorders in an array. This technology is non-invasive, can collect accurate data on any species that vocalizes, does not require prior field skills in identifying vocalizations (e.g. point counts, which can be challenging in diverse, but understudied systems like Borneo), can monitor the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife, and can provide information on species locations, movements, and intra-specific variations in behavior.","Microphone arrays comprising six SM2+ SongMeters per array will be set up in a pentagonal configuration with five SongMeters at distances of 50 m from a central SongMeter. The acoustic data collected by these arrays will be used to test various hypotheses (e.g. crowding and target effects) on how species use and move through remaining forest habitat left behind in the wake of logging. I will use the same methodology to test hypotheses on the impacts of logging and rainforest fragmentation on songbird vocalization behaviors (e.g. bird song and alarm calls). These vocalizations are fundamental in mate choice and in territorial behaviors and can be influenced by disturbances such as logging. During March-June 2013, I will collect pre-fragmentation data on the occurrence, movements and vocalization behaviors of all species in the following treatments: (i) boundaries of 100 ha fragments, (ii) core of 100 ha fragments, (iii) within 1 ha fragments and, (iv) contiguous old growth forest. This sampling protocol will be repeated during April-August 2014.By placing arrays at habitat edges, I will be able to estimate if, and the extent to which species are moving into (immigrating) and out of (emigrating) fragments, based on rapid changes in sound locations across these arrays (each detected sound has a precise time-stamp that allows for quantifying rapid changes in sound locations). This information will provide insights into the effective isolation of species in remaining forest fragments. Arrays located in contiguous forest will provide reference information regarding the distribution and movement of species in old growth settings.
As of August 2014, Block E has been created while the forests around Blocks D and F are being logged. Block B is yet to be logged and therefore serves as an undisturbed control site. I will deploy the microphone arrays in identical treatments - from August-November 2014 - during the ongoing forest clearing to capture the responses of species to the disturbance. This is a unique and time-sensitive opportunity to measure the responses of acoustically active animals to anthropogenic noise, logging and fragmentation as it occurs.
Data on alarm calls of various songbirds will be collected in a standardized manner by eliciting alarm responses via playbacks of predator and mobbing calls. The alarm calls of songbirds that are drawn in to the playback area will be recorded using a shotgun microphone and a solid state recorder. Observation data will be collected simultaneously on the species that made the call. Song types of different species and variations thereof are available on free online databases (e.g. Xeno-Canto). These vocalization exemplars of alarm calls and songs of different species can be coupled with acoustic detection softwares (e.g. SongScope, Raven Pro) to automatically detect the calls of various species in the field recordings made by the SongMeters. The SongMeter data will then be used to test various population and behavioral hypotheses on responses of birds to ongoing environmental change.","2013-04-01","2014-11-15",FALSE,FALSE,"",107,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-91","The impact of logging on density-dependent predation and recruitment of dipterocarp seeds during a mast-fruiting year","Density-dependent-predation-dipterocarp-seeds-110x110.jpg","rajeev.pillay@ufl.edu","Disturbances such as logging may undermine several key ecological processes that are necessary for the recovery and maintenance of diversity in tropical forests. The Janzen-Connell mechanism helps maintain plant diversity through specialized natural enemies that inhibit regeneration near parent trees where seed and seedling density is high and cause higher mortality of seeds and seedlings near the parent tree than far away. This local negative density dependence inhibits the regeneration of abundant species, while conferring an advantage to locally rare species and increasing the probability of establishment of heterospecifics.Plant reproduction in Southeast Asian rain forests is characterized by community-wide mast fruiting events at intervals between three to nine years. The most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that it evolved to satiate seed predators. Predator satiation decreases mortality at the highest densities, opposing the Janzen-Connell density-dependent mortality predictions. However, predator satiation can break down due to disturbances such as logging and forest fragmentation. The low densities of dipterocarp trees remaining after logging may not produce enough seeds to satiate seed predators. Furthermore, the isolation of adult dipterocarps relative to each other in logged forests may reduce cross pollination, thereby decreasing seed set.
During a mast-fruiting event, the situation in logged forests is expected to be similar to that in old growth forests during partial-fruiting episodes that occur sporadically outside of a mast year. In these partial-fruiting episodes, fruiting trees are isolated relative to each other. Seed predators may be attracted to isolated fruiting trees, decreasing seed survival close to parental trees relative to those dispersed far away. As a result, NDD may be expected to be high in logged forests during a mast year. It remains to be experimentally tested whether logging impacts density-dependent predation and recruitment success of dipterocarp seeds during a mast year. Since most dipterocarp recruitment is known to occur primarily during community-wide mast fruiting events, reduced recruitment during a mast year may have serious consequences for the recovery of logged forests.","Seedfall traps:
To test whether seed production rates are lower in logged forests relative to old growth, I will set up transects in four compass directions from the base of each tree, the first direction being random and subsequent directions being 90 degrees from the previous. Dipterocarp seeds are dispersed by gyration and usually land close to the parent tree. Seedfall traps will be deployed at distances of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 m along each transect. Each 1 m by 1 m seedfall trap will be made from mosquito nets and suspended with nylon cord at the corners. Traps will be used to establish seedfall rates soon after the occurrence of the first seedfall (late July-early August 2014).Unmanipulated plots to test the distance effect:
A 1 m by 1 m plot will be established 2 m to the left of each seedfall trap. Seeds found in the plots will be tagged with numbered plastic tags stapled to the wings. The presence and status of the tagged seeds will be checked at the same time as the seedfall traps and new seeds will be continuously tagged and monitored. The status of each seed will be recorded as potentially viable (no visible signs of insect or fungal attack), dead (decomposing or empty), germinated, fungus infected, insect predated (with exit holes), predated by vertebrates (partial remains of seed left behind) over time. Seedfall traps and experimental plots will be monitored every two weeks.
Density manipulation plots to test the density effect independent of distance:
To manipulate density and distance independently, I will establish two additional 1 m by 1 m plots at distances of 1 and 32 m from the base of the parent tree, adjacent to the existing traps. I will collect the seeds of the tree from the surrounding area and then assign plots to high density treatments at the far plots (addition treatment) and low density treatments at the near plots (removal treatment). These high and low density treatments will correspond to the highest and lowest density of seeds found naturally dispersed in the unmanipulated plots. After the addition of seeds, all seeds that fall into the plots thereafter will be removed throughout the experiment. Seeds will be assigned to the same categories as those in the non-manipulated plots.
Vertebrate exclusion plots to test the effect of vertebrate predation/herbivory on seed/seedling survival:
To investigate the contribution of vertebrate predators/herbivores to seed and seedling survival, I will pair the density manipulation plots above with caged plots at identical high and low seed densities. These vertebrate exclusion treatments will enable the comparison of seed and seedling survival both as independent and interactive effects of density and vertebrate herbivory in both logged and old growth treatments.","2014-07-01","2014-11-15",FALSE,FALSE,"",122,"|Plant Science|Ecology|"

These benefits extend downstream to lagoon and estuarine ecosystems and offshore to coral reefs and the fisheries they support. Disturbances to catchments in terms of logging, forest clearance and eventual conversion to oil palm often result in higher rates of erosion and sediment delivery to streams, causing adverse impacts downstream. Aside from the direct economic costs to landowners of losing infrastructure, soil and applied agrochemicals, increased sediment deposition from land-use change can result in higher peak discharges and longer term changes to flood regimes. More turbid and polluted river water also has consequences for riparian ecosystems and public health.This project will investigate the erosional impacts of land use change and human disturbance across the Brantian river catchment over the last 25-40 years using a combined sediment fingerprinting and radioisotope dating approach applied to sediment cores. Recent work in the Segama catchment in Sabah has demonstrated the potential for such an approach to indicate changes in erosion sources, processes and rates over time. Questions include:1) Can changes in geochemical composition down sediment cores be related to the gradient of spatial land-use change over time from old growth rainforest to oil palm conversion?
2) What are the multi-proxy geochemical 'signatures' of logging, clearance and conversion to oil palm and how robust are these signals?
3) How do these downcore geochemical signatures of land-use change vary between sub-catchments across the Brantian and over time?
4) How have erosion and sedimentation rates responded to the shifting mosaic of land-use change across the Brantian over time?
5) How do different land-use types and management practices affect erosion rates and sources of sediment supply?","This project will employ a nested catchment approach which allows a degree of control over the experimental research design by spatially 'isolating' the effect of individual sub-catchments (or a group of sub-catchments of desired total size or shared characteristics) the further one moves upstream towards headwater areas and smaller catchment sizes. This effect can be controlled depending on which confluence is selected as the lowermost point ('pour point') in the catchment. The logical extension of this approach is that by moving between confluences downstream or upstream we can observe the effect of adding or taking away, respectively, the contribution of fine sediment to the geochemical profile of the sediment core downstream. The observed effect on the downstream core resulting from that difference in contributing catchment area can then be compared to the known properties and characteristics of the sub-catchments such as spatial land-use history (logging, forest clearance and conversion to oil palm) or geology for example.The project will use a wide range of methods including:
1) Field surveys to identify suitable sites for fluvial sediment cores in downstream areas at the large and intermediate catchment scale, as well as upstream tributaries if possible to enable an historical 'core-to-core' sediment fingerprinting approach.
2) Combined erosion bridges and stake-and-washer units installed at sediment core sampling locations to investigate the nature of contemporary erosion and deposition in the catchment
3) Extraction of sediment core samples using overburden pits, sampling from every 2.5cm thick layer. Additional core samples taken from every 1cm depth layer for radioisotope analysis.
4) Sampling of fresh fine fluvial sediment deposited at upstream and downstream locations following flood events, for XRF analysis.
5) Supplementary cores taken on an ongoing basis following flood events in order to assess the impact of ongoing land-use changes and management practices in the catchment.
6) Analysis of down-core changes in sediment geochemical properties using a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental analyser.
7) Assessment of underlying geology at the various nested catchment scales using XRF analysis of a sample of clasts from the channel bed and by visual inspection.
8) Radioisotope dating of cores using Cs-137 and Pb-210 techniques.
9) Estimation of sedimentation rates over time using lead isotope analysis of down-core sediment samples.
10) Use of statistical techniques and a mathematical unmixing model as part of a multi-proxy sediment fingerprinting approach to explore relative contributions of sediment to a downstream core from distinct sub-catchments upstream.

Our goal is to go beyond the state-of-the-art in acoustic monitoring, developing and demonstrating technology that will monitor biodiversity continuously. We will deploy microphones in a tropical rainforest ecosystem, and use solar-powered transmitters to relay the signals to an automated computing system via a mobile phone network. The specific steps we will test and demonstrate in this proposal are the ability to: (1) continuously transmit acoustic data from a remote field site in tropical rainforest via mobile network; (2) continuously identify targeted species and run automated analyses of acoustic diversity on the data stream; (3) calibrate the acoustic metrics against empirical biodiversity data; (4) integrate the analysis outputs into a pre-existing online database (Data Management Plan); and (5) transmit both the acoustic record and diversity metrics to the public via an internet radio channel (Pathways to Impact). In this proposal we expect to develop the system to NERC Technology Readiness Level 4, testing a prototype system in a real world environment.","We will select six locations at which to establish continuous acoustic monitoring extending along a known gradient of diversity encompassing multiple levels of forest degradation (continuous primary and logged forest, small (1 ha), medium (10 ha) and large (100 ha) logged forest fragments, and oil palm plantation). We will deploy two omnidirectional, weatherproof microphones at each site; a regular acoustic microphone for detecting taxa such as frogs and birds and a high performance ultrasound microphone for detecting bats. Both microphones will be connected by cable to a single SM2BAT+ sound recorder that will use lossless compression to record acoustics in WAC format. The recorders store onto SD cards, and we will use WiFi enabled SD cards to allow continuous data streaming. SD card storage will be used as a manual backup in case of transmission failure. We will use triggered recording to reduce data loads from the ultrasonic microphones. We will also employ the 'rolling noise floor' trigger built into the SM2BAT+ recorder to prevent data being recorded during rainstorms, which occur almost daily in the study area. This system will require a 120 Watt power source in the field, which we will generate from a single solar panel connected to lead-acid batteries. Depending on the site conditions, we may have to elevate the solar panel above the forest canopy. The data will be received from the field with a lag of up to 24 hours, allowing us time to take a simplified approach and to avoid processing exclusively in memory: we will build small files representing distinct time segments and then analyse these in turn or in aggregate. We will use pre-recorded libraries of bird, bat and mammal calls, already collected by researchers at the SAFE Project, to select a small number (<10) of target species with distinctive acoustic signals. We will then use these to begin experimentation with automated species identification. We will use zero-crossing to identify the start and end point of individual songs that are significantly louder than the background noise within the continuous acoustic record, and use these time points to segment the file for analysis. We will use supervised learning approaches to classify the fingerprint signal of each of our target species, and compare the acoustic fingerprint of segmented files to the classifiers of the targeted species. Because of variation in background noise, among individuals and in distance from the microphone, we do not expect to obtain perfect fingerprint matches between labelled and unlabelled signals, so we will also return the statistical confidence that the segmented file represents the presence of one of our target species or another unidentified species. We will apply information metrics to estimate continuous acoustic analogues of Î± and Î² diversity. We will use multiple snapshot samples of diversity of the various taxa, and site records of the target species, at each of the acoustic monitoring sites at multiple time points to test the correlations between observed biodiversity and acoustically derived species records and information metrics.","2014-11-17","2016-11-18",FALSE,FALSE,"",53,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|"
"SAFE-PRJ-94","The Resilience of Tropical Forest Invertebrates to Microclimate Change","DSC5743-150x150.jpg","michael.boyle11@imperial.ac.uk","Climate and fragmentation induced changes will affect the fundamental processes that maintain ecosystem function and biodiversity, such as nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, herbivory and pollination. In tropical forests these processes are largely mediated by insects. Insects in tropical forests are expected to already live close to their upper critical temperature limits, so even small changes may impact their ability to survive, yet the effects of anthropogenic change on insect populations and their higher order interactions remain poorly understood. Aims This thesis aims to explore the effects of microclimate change on insect communities, with the goal of creating species specific ecophysiological models for a suite of functionally important invertebrates. Chapters will build up from core physiological data collection, through examining processes that will help to calibrate the models, to the construction of calibrated models that will pull together analyses from antecedent chapters. Chapters will fall under the following themes: 1. Diagnosis of critical temperature thresholds of functionally important tropical invertebrates 2. Phenotypic plasticity of thermotolerence and its expression across a forest disturbance gradient 3. Temporal thermal niche space; how do daily activity windows change across a disturbance gradient and what are the implications for competition, coexistence and community composition. 4. Predicting spatial and temporal changes in species assemblages under logging and climate change scenarios","I will experimentally determine the physiological tolerance of a range of functionally important insect species to microclimate change by live-capturing them in the field. Metabolic activity (respiration rate) of individuals will be measured in a ramping type assay over a range of locally relevant temperatures to determine thermal performance curves, showing lower and upper critical temperatures, and also thermal optima. Amount of oxygen used over unit time will be recorded, and normalized by body volume. These data will give an ecologically relevant measure of thermotolerence linked to individual performance. I will examine variation in thermotolerence among species as a function of species relatedness, and traits. The above experiment will be repeated for a subset of species after acclimation at elevated temperatures. By comparing shifts in thermal performance I will be able to gain an insight into how plastic certain species are in their response to high temperatures. The experiment will again be repeated on the same species, but from populations occurring in different levels of disturbed forest, which will have been subject to different microclimates for some time. This will give an interesting comparison of laboratory defined and field defined acclimation, and also help to investigate one aspect of adaptability, which will be crucial in calibrating subsequent models. It is likely that species will also adapt to changing conditions behaviourally, by adjusting foraging times and seeking refugia during the hottest parts of the day. For this reason daily average or maximum temperatures may lack the resolution required to explain habitat suitability. Forest patches that have been subject to increasing levels of disturbance will have varying daily temperature curves, and different species will be able to physiologically occupy different areas beneath these curves. The constraining effect of elevated temperatures on available niche space may have important implications for coexistence, competition and community composition. Activity of species can be investigated through bait removal experiments that can be repeated regularly over a 24hr period across a gradient of disturbance. These data can be assimilated with the core physiological data to investigate modulations in thermal and temporal niche space available to different species. The core physiological data will then be used to predict the presence/absence of species at >200 locations where daily maximum air and soil temperature have been recorded before, during and after logging and conversion of forest to agriculture. Predictions will be validated against existing field collections of invertebrate communities from those same sites. I will begin to add additional environmental parameters (tree species composition, soil pH, insectivore density etc.) and also try to calibrate models further using data obtained from the plasticity and niche space analyses. I will then use these calibrated models to predict spatial and temporal changes in species distributions across the landscape in response to microclimate change, which will be modelled under three scenarios: (1) land use change alone, comprising logging and forest fragmentation; (2) climate change alone; and (3) land use and climate change acting simultaneously.","2015-01-01","2018-01-01",FALSE,FALSE,"",126,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Microclimate|Invasive Species|"
"SAFE-PRJ-95","Algae and macroinvertebrate grazers: community and function changes in streams across a land use gradient","s5-150x150.png","alice.milton@hotmail.co.uk","Freshwater systems support much of the worldâ€™s aquatic diversity, including over 40% of all fish, despite accounting for less than 1% of the earthâ€™s surface of the surface water. They also provide key ecosystem services such as water purification, flood mitigation and areas for human recreation. Land use and land cover changes affects these systems physically, by altering river structures, chemically, through pollution and changes to nutrient input, and biologically, by changing the local species pool. The resulting impacts are not well understood and tropical freshwater systems in particular are understudied. What is clear is that these systems are under threat; extinction rates in freshwater systems are 4 to 6 times higher than in terrestrial or marine systems. Within streams, invertebrates are dominant in terms of diversity, abundance and function. One function of macroinvertebrates is the consumption of periphyton, a blend of algae, cyanobacteria, fungi and detritus, which forms one of the main autochthonous food sources in a stream system. The top-down control by macroinvertebrate herbivores on their food source is known to be greater than that of equivalent herbivores in terrestrial systems in temperate regions, but interactions of this kind have not been extensively studied in the tropics. In my research I aim to: 1. Assess the abundance and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in streams across a land-use gradient, focusing on herbivores 2. Assess the abundance and diversity of benthic algae in the same streams. 3. Measure periphyton removal rates in the same set of streams. 4. Where logging has occurred since 2011, compare the post-logging macroinvertebrate community with existing pre-logging data in order to look at the impact of land conversion on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community and 5. assess the value of riparian strips on preserving the diversity, abundance and function of periphyton-feeding macroinvertebrates.","Question 1: Surveys will be conducted along 200m transects at SAFE streams and additional Palm Oil plantation streams. Benthic macroinvertebrates will be sampled in riffles along a 200m transect at 10m intervals, using a Surber sampler. Large benthic macro invertebrates (crabs, shrimps, snails) will be sampled using bottle traps, also at 10m intervals along the same transect. Environmental variables for the streams will be taken at the same points, and will include nutrient (phosphate and nitrate) levels, pH, canopy cover, sediment/substrate analysis, stream depth and canopy openness. Forest quality analysis for the riparian strips, measured every 50m over a 500m transect on both sides of the streams, will include canopy openness, relascope readings and undergrowth density. Question 2: Samples of algae will be taken from rocks at randomised points along the stream transects, using a standardised protocol of scraping a projector-slide sized quantity of algae from rocks into a preservation solution. These will then be identified to analyse for taxonomic diversity, after which the ash-free dry mass will be quantified in order to get a measure of algal abundance. Question 3: Algal plates will be deployed in all the streams. After an initial cultivation period of four weeks I will place repeats within cages with mesh of 2 different grains: a coarser mesh to exclude large macroinvertebrate grazers such as snails, and vertebrate grazers such as fish but allowing herbivorous insects; and a fine mesh to exclude all grazers. Uncaged control plates will also be deployed. The percentage coverage of algal plates will be analysed visually every seven days for four weeks. For the final collection (day 28) all algae will be removed (by scraping) from the plates, and processed to give a measure of ash-free dry mass. Questions 4 and 5: Where logging has occurred since 2011, compare the post-logging macroinvertebrate community with existing pre-logging data in order to look at the impact of land conversion on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community and 5. assess the value of riparian strips on preserving the diversity, abundance and function of periphyton-feeding macroinvertebrates. Comparisons will be made between pre- and post-logging macroinvertebrate data collected at the SAFE and Palm Oil streams, and where riparian strips have been cleared to the experimental widths this will be used to explore the conservation value of riparian strips of different widths with regard the function, abundance and diversity of the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Where logging has only partially been carried out, or is being carried out, the surveys may be useful as a mid-disturbance data set, particularly in future work looking at the rate of species loss or extinction debt within aquatic systems.

"SAFE-PRJ-96","The effects of habitat modification on insect herbivores and herbivory rates in tropical rainforests","IMG_0282-110x110.jpg","lois.kinneen@griffithuni.edu.au","I will be joining Dr. Sarah Maunsell, Prof. Roger Kitching, Prof. Nigel Stork, Dr. Tom Fayle and Dr. Kalsum Yusah, working on the project 'Ecosystem quality and herbivore dynamics in tropical rainforests fragmented by deforestation'. Together, we will study the effects that forest modification and fragmentation have on the tri-trophic plant-insect herbivore-predator matrix. For my PhD I will be focusing on plant-insect herbivore interactions. A recent change in the literature highlighted the importance of studies which examine the effects of forest modification on ecological processes, rather than solely focusing on changes at species level (Ruiz-Guerra et al. 2010). Plant-insect herbivore dynamics represent some of the most dominant species interactions on the planet (Agrawal et al. 2012). The majority of herbivore damage in tropical ecosystems is carried out by invertebrate species (Coley & Barone, 1996). Plant-herbivore interactions have a wide range of effects on their ecosystem; from food-web structure, carbon and nutrient cycling to influencing individual plant fitness and therefore having cascading effects at a population level (Coley & Barone, 1996; Ruiz-Guerra et al. 2010; Metcalfe et al. 2013). Changes in herbivore communities therefore stand to have major implications for ecosystem quality. In 2015, I will collaborate with the Biodiversity and Land-use Impacts (BALI) project, specifically, the plant trait campaign led by Sabine Both, which aims to quantify the changes in plant functional trait distributions across a disturbance gradient. Insect herbivore community composition and their associated levels of foliar damage will be studied across this gradient. By linking these data with the BALI project's morphological, functional and physiological plant traits, we can assess the bottom-up impacts of changes in the availability and structure of plant resources on their insect herbivore community and whether or not the resulting changes in insect herbivore communities can be predicted by the functional diversity of trees.","In year 1, in collaboration with the plant trait campaign of the BALI project, insect herbivory levels will be measured in four 1ha plots of old-growth forest (two in Maliau Basin, two in Lambir hills) and in four logged forest plots (SAFE). The canopy will be accessed by a team of climbers who will provide material (both sun and shade branches) for all of the tree species that make up 80% of the basal area in each of the plots. Canopy material will be lowered onto a sheet on the ground and externally feeding insect herbivores will be collected by hand along with some of the leaf material on which the herbivore was seen feeding on, these caterpillars will then be reared through in order to identify them and as a means of assessing host-plant specificity for each species. The type of herbivore damage (eg. galls, leaf mines, damage by external chewers) will also be recorded in order to determine whether any pattern occurs in relation to the plant functional traits along the disturbance gradient. Percentage leaf damage by insect herbivores will be calculated to determine the level of herbivory that is occurring. This will involve taking photographs of a sample of leaves from each branch and then using imagery software such as ImageJ to quantify the damage. Galling insects and leaf miners will also be reared out from these leaves for identification purposes and in order to create a canopy food-web. Equivalent measurements will be taken in the understory in order to gain a comparison between ground and canopy herbivore dynamics. During my second year, I hope to study the effects of fragmentation by comparing plant-insect herbivore dynamics at the edges and interior of the fragments which will have then been established. This research will be carried out entirely within the SAFE project framework. References Agrawal, A.A., Hastings, A.P., Johnson, M.T.J., Maron, J.L. & Salminen, J-P.

"SAFE-PRJ-97","The Impacts of Tropical Rainforest Degradation on Networks of Ant-plant Mutualisms","DSC5743-150x150.jpg","wanjigirl@yahoo.com","Mass deforestation and habitat degradation are happening at a rapid pace around the world to facilitate anthropogenic activities, especially development and plantations. According to Malaysia Forest Information and Data, obtained from environmental news at Mongabay.com specifically at the link http://news.mongabay.com/2013/1115-worlds-highest-deforestation-rate.html , 14.4% of forest was lost from 2000 to 2012, an area estimated to be larger than Denmark. Most research has focused on how individual species survive these processes but the survival of species interactions has not been well studied. Though large areas of forest are now logged most parts of the logged areas are not yet converted. Hence understanding the way for forests regeneration is important. Pioneer plants are one of the component for effective forest regeneration. In SE Asia, species of tree in the pioneer genus, Macaranga provide ants of the genus Crematogaster with living space inside hollow stems, and food through secretions of sugars and food bodies. In return the ants give protection against herbivory activities (Feldhaar et al. 2010). These myrmecophytic (ant-inhabited) trees rapidly die if no ants are present, and the ants that live in the trees do not live elsewhere. Objectives: I. To determine how the Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction network changes with habitat degradation. II. To assess whether the persistence of protection of plants by ants is robust to habitat degradation. III. To assess whether the provision of food and living space by plants to ants in return for protection is affected by habitat degradation. IV. To propose management of this symbiotic interaction that will help in regeneration of heavily logged forests.","Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction networks and habitat degradation. i. We will first collate data on the distribution of all Macaranga species across the established SAFE vegetation plots. These trees will be located in the field, identified morphologically and also using available data and herbarium specimens. We will determine community patterns in Macaranga composition in relation to disturbance by conducting univiariate community analyses using General Linear Models (GLMs) to assess how Macaranga species richness, abundance and diversity are affected by habitat degradation. We will also use multivariate methods (DCA and CCA) to analyses how Macaranga species composition changes with disturbance. These data then will serve as basis for the experimental work described below. ii. To quantify shifts in Crematogaster-Macaranga interaction networks, we will assess ant occupancy of all Macaranga trees in the plots using direct collection of ants, and tuna baits hoisted on lines inserted into the canopy for taller trees (Yusah et al. 2012). We will survey Macaranga trees and all resident ants within these trees. Ants will be split into putative species on the basis of morphology, which will be confirmed or refined using molecular barcoding of COI sequences (Hebert et al. 2003). iii. We will analyses overall interaction network metrics including generality,vulnerability, nestedness, number of modules and modularity. Persistence of protection of plants by ants following habitat degradation. i. Trees will be assayed for rates of ant patrolling, ant attacks on a model herbivore, and herbivory rates will be assessed for smaller trees (<5m) (Edwards et al. 2010). These rates will be analyzed using a separate GLM for each tree species, with habitat type and ant symbiont identity as predictors. ii. Growth rate and flowering/fruiting data are available from the SAFE database for all trees >1cm DBH allowing assessment of whether occupancy by different ant species differentially affects growth rates or reproduction for particular Macaranga species and whether this varies between Macaranga species. Provision of food and living space by trees to ants and habitat degradation i. Macaranga provision of food bodies will be assessed. As for ant-provided benefits, the effects of partner identity and habitat on provisioning rate will be analyzed using GLMs. ii. To assess whether changes in benefits drive shifts in interaction networks we will look for correlations between the prevalence of particular interactions and the benefits provided by each partner. Management of symbiotic interaction and regeneration of heavily logged forests We will also conduct a series of transplants of a number of focal Macaranga species at increasing distances into continuous oil palm plantation from a source population of its inhabitant ants. We predict that more isolated plants will be less likely to be colonized by ants, and hence will be less likely to survive. The results of these experiments will inform management practices by revealing the degree of isolation within which myrmecophytic Macaranga will still thrive, and hence will inform reserve design within plantations, in particular of forests that are expected to regenerate.","2014-12-01","2015-03-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",125,"|Biodiversity|Plant Science|Zoology|Ecology|"

Seedling growth, survival and diversity are therefore critical to forest restoration and for maintaining healthy forest function. The seedling stage of a plant life cycle represents a population bottleneck, the recruitment process requires successful transition through seed production, dispersal, germination, growth and establishment. Seedlings are highly vulnerable to many biotic and abiotic factors and as such, selection pressure on them is strong. Environmental constraints, resource availability, competition and predation can all play key roles in shaping tree seedling communities which transfers to the wider adult community through time. Disturbance from logging can modify all such factors across a range of time-scales, both directly such as through soil compaction and indirectly through altered microclimate and parent community composition. Logging, then, can have major impacts on the ability of forests to regenerate. While factors influencing seedling success are reasonably well studied, no attempt has been made to model seedling growth rate and establishment rate in response to logging intensity. The gradient of logging intensity present at S.A.F.E, as well as the environmental heterogeneity and level of replication, provides a perfect opportunity to do so. The 2014 dipterocarp mast fruiting triggered by El Nino has also provided an abundance of seeds giving an ideal set-up to track seedling birth, death and growth over time with sufficient data. I will test the hypothesis that logging reduces tree seedling growth, establishment and diversity and increases seedling mortality.","Hamzah Bin Tangki established 84 seedling plots of 5x5m with a 2x2m subplot at S.A.F.E. in April 2011 (see here). Seedlings above 50cm height but below 1cm DBH in each plot, and seedlings below 50cm in each subplot, were identified, measured and labelled in the field. I will re-survey the 84 seedling plots, recording height and diameter measurements for all seedlings. The number of leaves of each seedling will also be recorded as a further metric of seedling size. In combination with the earlier census data, these measurements will provide me with species-specific establishment rates, growth rates and mortality rates. Soil temperature, canopy cover and soil moisture measures are already available from other researchers working at S.A.F.E., as will be species-level records of parent trees within plots. I will add measurements of soil pH, leaf litter depth and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at ground level at each plot to these supporting data. I will construct a species-specific birth-death model for the seedling community at S.A.F.E. which simulates seedling establishment and mortality as a function of the parent community and the environmental parameters mentioned. A further model will consider seedling growth rate as a function of the environmental parameters.

However, the experimental system represented by SAFE has begun to uncover mammalian community responses to habitat degradation, with permanent sampling grids of live and camera traps set up by PhD candidate Oliver Wearn (Imperial College). I aim to continue and expand this sampling effort to examine changes in dispersal and movement behaviour of mammals in response to habitat degradation. This is a key process linking individuals and populations with ecosystem-level processes such as seed dispersal and predation, and the ability of mammals to maintain normal movement patterns after habitat disturbance and degradation is likely to directly influence population persistence in a fragmented landscape. The timing of fragment creation/clearance work at SAFE allows a unique insight into whether any direct, instantaneous changes in movement patterns occur as a result. In particular, I aim to test whether individuals move into fragments from outside areas as they are logged leading to transient crowding effects, which have been documented by other studies but rarely properly investigated. As well as testing for this via changes in within-fragment density of individual species, I will use unique marking of individual to model the directional tendency of recaptures (are animals more likely to be recaptured away from fragment edges?), and measure potential health costs of crowding via biometric and parasite data. I will also extend the small mammal live trapping to target larger mesocarnivores, and track them using VHF radio or GPS tags, or a combination of both, to investigate whether disturbance drives spatiotemporal changes in ranging and territorial behaviour.","The core of my methodology is the small mammal live trapping grids set up by Oliver Wearn at the third-order sampling points in the SAFE fragment system. In particular, I will maintain 12 grids as permanent effort sites throughout my three field seasons: all six grids in fragment E, the two grids in the Fragment D 100ha block, two grids in the Oil Palm plantation, and two grids in the old growth controls at Maliau Basin. Each grid comprises 48 trapping points spaced 23m apart, for a total dimension of 276x92m. Each point is GPS-located and marked with a permanent pole, and contains two Tomahawk-style cage traps within a 5m radius. Traps are baited with oil palm fruit, and each grid is run continuously for seven days. All small mammal captures are identified to species level, and if not already marked the individual is marked with a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag that gives a unique identifying number when scanned with an electronic receiver. Biometric data is taken before the animal is released. I will also be continuing to run the network of camera traps within the live-trapping grids. These are run at a randomly-sampled subset of the live-trapping grids, and set up when live-trapping is not going on. Using recent theoretical advances it should be possible to obtain density estimates from camera-trapping data, which will complement the live-trapping results to provide a community-level picture of changes in density and dispersal. Lastly, I will extend the live trapping methodology with targeted trapping of mesocarnivores, particularly civets (Viverridae). Again using a randomised subset of the permanent trap points, I will deploy larger cage traps baited with carrion to attract these species, and attach VHF and/or GPS tags to captured adult individuals. Using either a UAV-mounted receiver for VHF tags or a network of fixed receiver stations for GPS tags, these individuals will be tracked for an extended period (c. 10-30 days) with regular fixes made to establish home range size and shape. I will combine this approach with GPS mapping of logging gaps and clearings (and GPS data from bulldozer position) to model any spatial constraints operating on home range configuration via disturbance-driven habitat heterogeneity. Pilot investigations for this part of the project will occur in 2015, chiefly to determine which methodology is most practical, the results of which should inform experimental tracking in 2016.","2015-03-01","2017-07-31",FALSE,FALSE,"",124,"|Biodiversity|Zoology|Ecology|Agriculture|"
"SAFE-WEB-1","Functional composition of trees and liana communities","tree-tag-safe-110x110.jpg","daisy.h.dent@gmail.com","Plant functional traits define species' ecological strategies, performance and distributions. Functional traits determine plant ecological strategies via trade-offs whereby the functional traits that maximize plant fitness in one context are inappropriate for another. For example, traits that sustain high maximum growth rates in high light (such as, high leaf N concentrations, low leaf mass per area and low wood density) limit allocation to storage and defence and reduce the likelihood of survival in the shade. We propose to measure eight key functional traits of tree and liana species: leaf N and P concentrations, leaf toughness, leaf mass per area, wood density, maximum tree height, diaspore and seed mass. Many of these traits not only underlie ecological strategies but also affect ecosystem functions such as carbon storage and nutrient cycling. For example, wood density and maximum height determine the amount of carbon stored within individual tree stems, and LMA and leaf nutrient concentrations affect rates of leaf litter decomposition and nutrient cycling.  Little is known about how functional traits change with forest disturbance and fragmentation, and how these changes affect key ecosystem functions. This project will generate a data-base of species specific trait data, which will enable us to address three research objectives. Firstly, in combination with tree species composition we will be able to follow how functional composition of forests change with fragmentation. Secondly, in combination with forest structure data, wood density measurements will enable us to accurately predict carbon storage in different forest types. And finally, in combination with litter decomposition data we can begin to determine the role that changes in functional composition have on nutrient cycling. Specifically, we will assess 1) if species with traits typical of light-demanding, weedy species become more abundant with fragmentation, 2) how this trend is affected by fragment size and isolation, and 3) how changes in functional composition affect ecosystem function.","We will measure eight functional traits of tree and liana species: leaf N and P concentrations, leaf toughness, LMA, wood density, maximum tree height, diaspore and seed mass. We will gather trait data from at least 80% of species represented in the forest census plots and focussing our efforts on more abundant species. For trait collection our methods will follow Cornelissen et al. (2003). Leaf traits(LMA, leaf toughness, N and P concentrations) will be measured on three leaves per individual from 10 randomly selected individuals per species. Because leaf traits vary substantially with light availability we will collect leaves from standard light levels (Cornelissen et al. 2003). Leaf chemical analysis will be conducted at the University of Stirling, UK. Wood density will be measured by coring trees with a forestry wood increment borer for at least five individuals per species that span a range of DBH. To estimate maximum tree height, we will measure the height of the six largest individuals of each free-standing species within the forest census plots. For diaspore and seed mass, we will collect five mature fruits from five individuals of each species. Fresh diaspore mass will be measured immediately after harvest.

Aquatic invertebrates spend all or part of their life cycle in a stream. These invertebrates are adapted to aquatic life for example adapted to breath underwater, some are able to search for food by being a shredder which feeds on large leaf and wood debris, some are adapted of being collectors which they obtain nutrients by collecting and filtering organic matters from the stream. A polluted stream does not possess high species richness in terms of aquatic invertebrates which indicates that aquatic invertebrates could not survive in polluted streams. EPT which stands for three major orders of aquatic insects are Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera is used as common bio-indicator for a healthy stream. The Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera basically is to show that a high-quality and healthy stream usually have the highest species richness because most aquatic insect species are intolerant of pollutants. The aims of this study are 1) To study the composition and distribution of EPT along the streams of SAFE project, Kalabakan. 2) To study the composition of EPT in each different land use and habitat in SAFE project, Kalabakan. 3) To study the relationship of EPT communities with the water quality of streams in SAFE project, Kalabakan.","The sampling will be conducted at three different types of streams in the SAFE project, Kalabakan, which is Virgin Jungle Reserve (Sg.
