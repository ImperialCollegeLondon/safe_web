Cameras up until recently have only been used on land, placed near the ground to study terrestrial studies. When scientists and conservationists get an arboreal species, such as a binturong on their ground based cameras, it sparks questions like ‘Why did it come to the ground’ and ‘What behaviour and individuals can be found in the tree canopy’. For species like the binturong which are difficult to study using traditional methods transferring the technology of camera traps to the canopy could provide some exciting new insights. This could apply to many  groups of poorly-known species, including civets, squirrels, cats, primates and even birds.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/binterong-ground-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><p>© Hayley Brant, Oliver Wearn and Amy Fitzmaurice (2014)</p><p>Myself and two other researchers (Oliver Wearn and Hayley Brant) were interested in these arboreal species and camera trapping. So during 2014, several cameras were placed in trees at the Stability of Altered Forest Project (SAFE) at a Virgin Jungle Reserve, by fellow researcher and tree climber Hayley Brant. Who said “after I encountered a binturong in the canopy, whilst collecting mosquitoes from my research, we decided to place the cameras in a fruiting fig tree for a few weeks. We were amazed by the results, but unfortunately all the canopy photos had my temporary climbing lines into carry out my own research. These camera trap photos showed the potential of capturing the behaviour of arboreal species.” Oliver Wearn, a fellow researcher that helped in species identification spoke about the exciting behaviour of arboreal species that camera trapping in trees showed. He said “it was really exciting to see, even in just a short period of trapping, the sorts of new behavioural insights these methods could provide in the future. For example we captured on camera the strong competition between binturongs for figs, an ephemeral but clearly a very important resource for this threatened species.”</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/binturong-tree-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><p>© Hayley Brant, Oliver Wearn and Amy Fitzmaurice (2014)</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/orang-tree-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><p>© Hayley Brant, Oliver Wearn and Amy Fitzmaurice (2014)</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/binturongs-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><p>© Hayley Brant, Oliver Wearn and Amy Fitzmaurice (2014)</p><p>There are other organisations testing to see if camera trapping in trees could provide useful scientific data on arboreal species such as the Heart of Borneo Project and the Orangutan Tropical Peatland Foundation. Tim van Berkel from the Heart of the Borneo Project described “We have trialled setting a few cameras in the upper canopy and emergent trees. This is quite a challenge, accessing a tree and setting up a camera can take a full day. However, the results could be spectacular. We observed a squirrel and little known flying squirrels, as we as some skinks. Promising results for the two days the cameras were up in the trees.” Susan Cheyne from the Orangutan Tropical Peatland Project said “Given that many animals in tropical rainforests are arboreal we are missing out on vital behavioural information and details of arboreal species by not having camera traps in the trees. It is certainly more challenging than placing camera traps on the ground but the rewards are worth the effort.”</p><p>To answer the question, Camera Trapping in Trees?, the answer is definitely yes, but there is a lot of research to be done to understand the best methodologies to provide useful data. With the potential for solar-powered and wireless camera traps in the future, as well as the use of drones to deploy cameras in the canopy things might be about to get even more exciting in the world of camera trapping.</p>"

We do this to measure soil emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and volatile organic carbon compounds. Installing the frames is not always as easy as it looks, hidden roots and stones mean that we have to try several times to find a suitable location to hammer the frames into the soil. However with the help of our strong RAs (Arnold, Mus, Sany) and Julia we still managed to install 56 chambers much faster than planned.

WP A focuses on the effect of forest modification (gradient from almost intact forest to mature oil palm) on emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide, methane, soil respiration of carbon dioxide, biogenic volatile organic carbon emissions and underlying changes in the overall and active soil microbial population. We speculate that the overall greenhouse gas emissions from oil palm are much larger than from the forest ecosystems. Only very few measurements have so far have compared greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical forest ecosystems with oil palm plantations, so our work adds to the global data base and allows better quantification of the greenhouse gas footprint of forest modification.</p>"

However, camera trapping in and around the Kalabkan Forest Reserve has now discovered a third population. Camera trapping surveys were carried out between 2011 and 2014, as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystem Project (SAFE Project).</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/BP_E100_2_217-2-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><p>Camera trapping has snapped the rare species on four occasions in the SAFE Project area (once in 2011 and 2012 and twice more in 2014), over two separate experimental blocks of forest separated by 6km. The species was also caught on camera in 2013 during camera trap surveys in the nearby Brantain-Tatulit Virgin Jungle Reserve, which is a fully protected patch of old-growth forest. Oliver Wearn, a PhD researcher from Imperial College London who leads the camera trapping surveys, said “This species has still never been seen by anyone working at the SAFE Project site, despite many years of man hours in the forest. The photos came as a complete surprise once I realised what I was looking at. It underlines just how useful camera trapping can be as a scientific tool.”</p><p>Randomised camera trapping has shown that a species stated to prefer primary forests and that is vulnerable to disturbance, occurs in forested areas that have been twice logged since the 1970s and is surrounding by logging activities. This information is valuable for conserving an endemic species of Borneo that is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN RedList.</p><p>These latest records from the Kalabakan Forest Reserve are from a highly degraded selectively logged area of forest, which extends the known habitat preferences for this species. Amy Fitzmaurice, a Master’s student at Imperial College London who discovered the most recent images, said “Our understanding of the impacts of logging on species is limited and using camera trapping to study rare and elusive species is vital for our understanding of this complex issue in order to conserve biodiversity.”</p>"
166,"2015-01-20","unnamed-110x110.jpg","Camp life - at Seraya","Rajeev Pillay","<p>I had been out in the forest since 4:00 AM and returned to camp in time for breakfast. As I helped my Research Assistants Mai and Jef whip up a large pot of instant noodles and fry some eggs, I kept a watchful eye on the Koompassia excelsa tree that towered right next to the campsite. Specifically, I kept a keen watch on the twin hives of the giant honeybee (Apis dorsata) that hung like enormous pendulous tumors from the branches of the tree. I was not at the SAFE campsite with its many attendant luxuries but at the tiny makeshift campsite that had been set up for researchers who worked in the old growth control plots on the Seraya trail in the Maliau Basin.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2382-187x250.jpg' width='230' height='307'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2384-300x225.jpg' width='414' height='310'><p>OG1 or Seraya as it is better known among the researchers of SAFE, is one of three old growth control sites in the Maliau Basin, the other two being Belian (OG2) and Gravity (OG3). It is the most distant of the three control sites from the Maliau Basin Studies Center (MBSC) as well as the most challenging in terms of its terrain, with the steepest plots being approximately 3 hours away on foot. Stretches of the rain forest along the Seraya trail have been scarred by landslides and are blocked by a dense understory reminiscent of logged forests. A parang or the trusty Sabahan field knife to hack through the understory is a must when working in Seraya, as it is in the logged forests at SAFE. However, most of the forest along this trail is pristine and is among the most magnificent old growth forests I have ever had the privilege of walking in. Not every researcher needs to camp out when working in the Seraya plots but if one works on birds and if research protocols demand an early start to a field day, no other options exist. The campsite is around a two-hour walk away from MBSC and conveniently located adjacent to a couple of the OG1 plots. The furthest OG1 plots are still around 40 minutes away. The facilities at the camp are ultra basic with an adjacent stream serving as a bathing spot as well as a source of drinking water. A large tarpaulin sheet designed to protect around six people from the rain has been stretched under the canopy of the trees. A similar-sized tarp is stretched across the forest floor under this roof. Mountain-style zip-up tents have been permanently stored at the campsite for sleeping in and can be assembled at short notice. A small hammock is the only other luxury in this sleeping area. A covered “kitchen” area has been erected around 10 meters away from the sleeping area, next to the stream. Butane gas stoves, a few pots and pans for cooking, a kettle for boiling water and plastic plates and spoons are also permanently stored at the site in several layers of plastic bags, ready for the next researcher wishing to use the facility.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2484-300x225.jpg' width='343' height='257'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2470-300x225.jpg' width='339' height='254'><p>This day in June 2014 marked the second occasion that I was using the campsite at Seraya. Some of the plots for my playback experiment onpredation risk for songbirds are in OG1. These plots are too far away from MBSC to reach by 6:00 AM, as was required by my experimental protocol. Consequently, I needed to camp out every time I set up my SongMeter arrays in the OG1 plots (for more details on my work read this blog). Coinciding with the 2014 El Nino, a mass flowering was underway in the early part of the year and would lead to a mast fruiting later on. The effect of the El Nino was particularly pronounced in the old growth forest in the Maliau Basin, with most of the dipterocarps covered with what, from a distance, looked like dull brown fuzz, the visual effect of thousands of winged fruits maturing on the branches. Many species of bee were extremely active during the mass flowering, taking full advantage of the abrupt preponderance of readily available nectar. Hardly a day would pass when I did not hear the buzzing of a swarm of bees flying over the canopy in search of their preferred flowering species. The buzzing of thousands of bees flying together was menacing indeed and literally resembled the sound produced by a formation of fighter planes flying overhead on a sortie. When a swarm of bees was overhead, I would simply take cover and try to attract as little attention as possible, aware that my sweat-soaked clothes could serve as an attractant for bees, which have a liking for the salt secreted from sweat glands. Giant honeybees can severely injure a human if they sting in large numbers and potentially even cause death if immediate medical attention is unavailable. I am aware of a case where an individual passed out unconscious after being stung around 60 times by a swarm of enraged giant honeybees. Fortunately, help was available at hand and he survived, albeit with several scars on his head and body as reminders of the attack. During an earlier camping stint at Seraya in May 2014, I had noticed the bees commencing building their hives on the Koompassia tree. They were quite active even as early as 4:00 AM, so much that I had to ask Mai to flash his head-torch from inside his tent to enable us to get dressed for fieldwork. If I attached my torch to my head, the bees would fly straight into my face and neck, attracted by the light. The sweat on our clothes and possibly our human scent attracted not just giant honeybees but also a smaller bright orange species, which packs a vicious sting, and the omnipresent and innumerable sweat bees, which can sting uncomfortably in sensitive spots such as the neck and armpits into which they often crawl. For a short video of  the bees click SerayaBees</p><p>I had returned to camp that day after setting up my loudspeakers in a couple of plots for my playback experiment. The day was by no means over though and I intended to take around an hour of rest post breakfast, and then hike to a couple of other plots to measure understory and canopy vegetation cover. When famished from working in the forest since dawn, a simple breakfast of instant noodles, fried eggs and coffee can turn into the most delicious meal in the world, each bite savored and prolonged for greater enjoyment. We retired into our tents after breakfast, leaving a slit open to let fresh air in and keep the bees out as best as possible. Around 10 AM, the bees were increasingly bombarding the campsite, attracted by the sweat on our clothes, which we had hung out to dry. They formed a layer of writhing black and gold blobs on our clothes, rather repulsive to look at. The tiny sweat bees managed to enter our tents through minute openings. The stifling heat in the confined space of the tents, the incessant buzzing, the tickling sensation caused by sweat bees crawling on our skin and the occasional sharp stings soon became unbearable. As I emerged from my tent, a couple of giant honeybees crawled under my collar and promptly stung me on the back of my neck. Muttering a series of expletives under the intense pain, I gathered my field gear with alacrity and evacuated the camp with Mai and Jef for the remainder of the day. Hopefully, the bees would be less active when we returned from fieldwork in the late evening.</p><p>On returning to camp in the evenings, we would each have a quick dip in the stream and return to our tents. The bees had usually calmed down considerably by then. We would set about cooking the evening meal, which usually comprised boiled rice and canned chicken or sardines. Again, when one is tired and ravenous, such simple fare can be more delectable than the food served at a Michelin star restaurant. Perhaps the ambience of the rainforest, the calls of the cicadas and evening birds, the wind blowing gently though the trees and the stars in the evening sky also contribute in mysterious ways to vastly enhance the flavor of even thesimplest food. I would carry a book or some papers to read in the evenings, as long as the fading light allowed me to. I avoided reading by torchlight as it meant carrying more batteries, and therefore more weight, than absolutely necessary. We would finish dinner under candlelight by 7 PM, indulge in idle banter with each other for a while and then go to bed around 8 PM as there was little else to do.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2418-187x250.jpg' width='338' height='453'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2428-300x225.jpg' width='432' height='324'><p>Virtually every night, we were rudely awakened by the sound of our pots and pans clanging and crashing down from the stove. A resident Malay civet was always the culprit, robbing left over rice and other food from our dinner. Mai was convinced that the smell of food would attract a sun bear, which never happened, although I wish it had! Each time the civet banged the pots, he would poke his head out of his tent and flash his torch in the direction of the sound, hoping it was not a sun bear! It rained gently every night I spent in Seraya, the sound of the raindrops splashing on the tarp blocking out most other sounds of the forest. The rain would usually cease by dawn. Fortunately, there was never a storm on any night. I have little doubt that a typical Bornean cloudburst would rapidly cause a raging torrent to flow underneath our tents. On a couple of occasions, I heard a gigantic crash and thud in the night. This was the sound of a hoary forest giant falling to the forest floor at the termination of its life, its demise making way for a sapling to rise through the gap and providing nutrients to numerous other plants over the next few years.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2377-300x225.jpg' width='417' height='312'><p>I camped out at Seraya on three occasions in 2014, each time for two nights. When I began my third camping stint in July, the bees had quieted down considerably as the flowering had almost culminated. Mature fruits were now beginning to fall from the heavily laden branches of the trees. A carpet of seeds and seedlings would cover the forest floor in the coming months. On the last evening of camping, I was resting at the entrance of my tent after a long day in the forest, reading in the fading light. Mai and Jef were at the entrances of their respective tents, busy playing games on their cellphones. The kettle was whistling away next door in the kitchen. I was startled to see Mai abruptly sit up and then bolt from his position as if galvanized by a jolt of electricity. He hared several feet away, pointing at the plastic bag of food next to where he was sitting and yelling “samud”, which means ant in Bahasa Melayu. A huge column of fire ants had made its way to our food and was a few inches away from our tents. All three of us raced to find flammable bits of wood and paper that we could use to create a smoke barrier and prevent the fire ants from invading our tents. The prospect of being bitten by a seething mass of fire ants in our sleep was nightmarish, given that the bite of even one fire ant can cause an intense burst of pain that has to be experienced to be believed. It took us the better part of the evening to divert the ant column from their intended route through our tents and to salvage the rest of our food.</p><p>I was excited at the prospect of camping out in Bornean rain forests the first time I did it. I confess though that it was not something I looked forward to from then on, given the rigors of the conditions in the forest, even though it was for only two nights each time. On each occasion, my boys and I would find it easier to fall asleep on the first night rather than on the second. Despite being more tired on the second night, I would find it almost impossible to sleep on the hard forest floor with tree roots sticking into my back, try as I might to find a comfortable position. When we set out from MBSC, we were each so loaded with scientific equipment, food, water, changes of clothes, butane gas canisters, candles and miscellaneous gear that there was no question of carrying comfortable bedding. We ate all our food before heading back but it was replaced with 14 SongMeters, each of which weighed around 2.5 kg. We also had to bring back all the other scientific gear we had carried in. Carrying heavy backpacks in the demanding terrain of Seraya is not trivial. Therefore, I was pleased and rather touched when Harbin, Mai’s brother, once arrived at the campsite just as we were packing up to head back. I had not requested his help but he had walked all the way by himself just to assist us carry our gear back.</p><p>Looking back, I feel I am better off for having gone through the experience of camping out in Seraya. Memories of hardship undergone can be sweet, especially when one has been successful in achieving one’s objectives. I was exhausted at the end of each camping stint but happy at having acquired the data I needed to further my research. There is something primal about spending a night in the middle of the rain forest without any electricity, cellphone network or running water. Even the morning songs of the gibbons sound more resonant and powerful. When I returned from my last evening of camping in July, I fell into a deep sleep for several hours but woke up at 4:00 AM again – not for fieldwork this time but to watch the 2014 Football World Cup Final between Germany and Argentina on the conference room TV at MBSC. What more can one ask for when in the middle of the rainforest? Life at Maliau and SAFE rocks indeed!</p>"
166,"2015-01-15","IMG_2666-110x110.jpg","Into the Wild at Dawn","Rajeev Pillay","<p>The alarm buzzed at 3:30 AM, penetrating my dreams and jolting me awake. As I sat up groggily, I heartily wished that I could enjoy the luxury of sleeping on until daylight, like the rest of my fellow researchers. I stumbled out of my mosquito net, groped around for my head-torch and tried to put on my field clothes, my sleep-deprived state and clumsy haste making me put my fatigues on backwards! Getting dressed at last, I went up to the kitchen area at camp, where I grabbed a few crackers from the tin for breakfast, packed my lunch-box with left-overs from the previous night’s dinner and filled up my water bag. I was ready for a long day ahead in the forest. I work on birds, specifically how songbirds respond to the perception of predation risk and how changes in the protective vegetation cover due to logging may mediate this risk. The experimental design of my study demanded that I reach my sampling locations at 6:00 AM sharp. To accomplish this, I needed to set forth from camp by 4:00 AM or at times even earlier, depending on the distance and accessibility of the location. This day, in April 2014, was the very first early morning of many to come, since I would be able to complete sampling all my experimental plots only by late August.</p><p>I remember that first morning vividly. The camp was silent and in darkness, the generator having been cut off at midnight and almost everyone deep in slumber. Zinin, my Research Assistant for that day, and Ryan, who was driving me to Block D, were the only others awake. The night sky was clear, with a myriad stars and the full moon bathed the forest in a surreal light. The air was cool and pleasant, completely unlike the stiflingly hot and humid atmosphere when one sets off to the forest at the regular time of 8:00 AM. Within minutes, I was invigorated, alert and thoroughly enjoying myself, the discomfort of rising early forgotten, motivated by the prospect of exhilarating wildlife encounters at dawn, excited to watch the imminent sunrise and even contemplating how privileged I was to be able to carry out my doctoral field research in the rain forests of Borneo!</p><p>My experimental protocol involved manipulating perceived predation risk for songbirds by playing back the vocalizations of accipiters (forest hawks) and owls through portable loudspeakers. Simultaneously, I was recording the response of songbirds to this risk with automated recording microphones known as SongMeters. These SongMeters can capture the sounds made by all species that produce audible vocalizations, are non-invasive, covert and can collect a great wealth of information the vocalization behaviors of species that occur within an area and how they respond to environmental change such as logging and rain forest fragmentation. I would arrive at the experimental plots where I had set up microphone arrays a few days earlier, set up portable loudspeakers in these plots and start the playbacks to coincide with the dawn chorus of songbirds. Working as silently and quickly as possible, I would leave the plot after setting up all the loudspeakers and move to another plot which did not have the arrays running concurrently. Here, I would measure understory and canopy vegetation cover in detail. All of this took a lot of time and I would often return only by 5:00 PM or so.</p><p>On most mornings, I was hot, profusely sweaty, tired and bleeding from leech bites after a long hike over challenging terrain to get to an experimental plot. However, watching the sunrise is always energizing and awe inspiring, akin to a revitalizing tonic. The eastern horizon takes on a pink glow, which spreads slowly over the entire sky. The red orb of the sun then rises majestically over the smoky blue hills in the distance. The light filters through the trees, forming individual golden beams that play on patches of the dark forest floor as if powerful flashlights have been switched on. Shortly thereafter, the sun becomes a dazzling gold that hurts the eyes if one looks at it directly. Birds and Muller’s Bornean gibbons commence their dawn chorus at around 5:30 AM as the sky begins to lighten. The sun is fully up half an hour later.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_9391-300x199.jpg' width='470' height='311'><p>On several occasions, I was rewarded with exciting wildlife sightings. Leopard cats, Malay civets, Malay porcupines and long-tailed porcupines were plentiful on morning drives to my experimental plots. In Maliau, while on the Belian trail, mouse deer and barking deer would often be present at several locations. They would initially freeze in the glare of the powerful head torches that my Research Assistant’s and I used and then bolt as they detected our movements behind the lights. On one occasion I counted as many as nine mouse deer, each around 300 m or less from the previous one – all along the same trail. Again on the Belian trail, my RAJef and I once spotted a moon rat at close quarters. While I had captured moon rats before on my camera traps, I had not realized quite how large they can be. This one was around a foot long (without measuring the tail), pure white, with a shrew-like snout and sharp teeth.</p><p>Elephants are fairly rare at SAFE but occasionally move through the area. Although encounters with elephants can be exciting, they are a species that I would rather avoid while on foot. While working in the 1 ha plots of Block B one morning, I heard the deep rumbles of an elephant herd in the adjacent 100 ha plot. Fortunately, the elephants did not come any closer and we were able to emerge unscathed. During my 2013 field season, elephants had almost ambushed me while I was recovering camera-traps in Block E. A new logging road had just been opened in Block E and elephants were not expected at all in this heavily disturbed area. However, as I commenced walking up the newly created logging road, dinner-plate sized footprints of elephants as well as copious amounts of fresh dung indicated the presence of a large herd in the vicinity. The herd had passed by the night before, given the freshness of the dung and the strong elephant smell that pervaded the air. I cautiously walked up the road with my RA’s, Jef and Zinin. As we rounded a corner, the road ended and we entered the forest. An elephant trumpeted all of a sudden at very close quarters, the scream piercing the air and sounding even more ominous in the closed space of the forest. Jef and Zinin glanced at me nervously, eager to turn back. However, I had to recover that camera-trap, as it was my last day at SAFE for my 2013 field season. Zinin fished out his cigarettes to calm his nerves, putting them back reluctantly after I admonished him not to smoke with elephants so close at hand. The camera trap location was around 400 m away. We inched our way forward as silently as possible, recovered the camera trap without further incident and beat a hasty retreat.</p><p>Hiking up the hill to Block B one day before dawn, I heard a harsh scream, almost human. I was initially unable to associate it to an animal but soon realized it was the alarm call of a sambar. Bornean sambar sound quite different from sambar in India, which have a short, deep, bellowing “dhank” as an alarm call.</p><p>One afternoon, while returning from Block B, I was walking far ahead of Mai and Denny, my RA’s for that day. As I walked along silently, lost in thought, I saw the grass move on the side of the road around 10 feet ahead of me. Expecting a bearded pig or at best, a muntjak at that time of the day, I stopped and watched the grass intently. A red hand and arm emerged, followed by the owner – a large female orangutan. The orangutan had not heard me and came out from the grass with its back towards me, shuffling along as it crossed the road. All of a sudden, it realized that all was not well behind and spun around to come face to face with me. I will never forget the expression of surprise in its eyes. I was half expecting it to charge or be aggressive, given that I had surprised it at such close quarters. However, it was just as shocked as I was and quickly retraced its path to hasten up an adjacent tree. Such encounters, albeit rare and brief, make arduous hours spent in the field highly worthwhile.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2738-187x250.jpeg' width='257' height='344'><p>A Smiling Mai</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Jef-Mai-187x250.jpg' width='187' height='250'><p>Setting up the SM2’s</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_2739-187x250.jpeg' width='187' height='250'><p>Jeff birding</p><p>In those early days, most of the future forest fragments at SAFE and the sampling locations within them were not directly accessible by motorable roads. Reaching the sampling plots at distant locations such as Block F, involved an hour of driving followed by more than an hour of hiking through hilly, leech-infested secondary forest with a dense, almost impenetrable, understory. On the days I was working in these locations, I would have to leave camp as early as 3:30 AM to ensure I was on time for commencing work. Working in the old growth forests along the Seraya trail in the Maliau Basin was even more challenging as only foot trails exist to access sampling locations. Each occasion of sampling in Seraya (or OG1), necessitated camping out for two days at a stretch. Mai and Jef, my Research Assistants who had been assigned to me for almost the entire duration of my time at SAFE from 2012-14, gamely put up with such difficult fieldwork. Seldom did they even mention that they were tired. Had it not been for their able help, fieldwork would have been almost impossible. Despite the sweat, grime and leeches, I miss setting off for the forest before dawn. I miss the cool air playing on my face and watching the sunrise. I miss the dawn chorus of the gibbons and birds. Memories of those times at SAFE and Maliau are fond indeed.</p>"

Volunteers story","Leona Wai","<p>During my previous semester break, which was on the 23 July 2014, three of us (Huai En,Kok Kiat and me) went for volunteering work at SAFE, Tawau for about 1 month. We took 10 hours+ to get to Tawau by bus. After we reached Tawau, one of the people from SAFE, Magat, when to fetch us in town. We took another 3 hours+ to reach SAFE. It was my first time having a journey for that long!</p><p>When we reached SAFE, we were introduced to some of the researcher there and our beloved boss, Sarah Maunsell. We helped Sarah doing her moths research and we went to field to help her sampling and did some lab work such as pinning, labeling and sorting. Forest at SAFE is quite challenging but fun. The hills are quite steep and the tracks are full of thorny plants. I learnt how to use the GPS correctly and how to find a suitable point to set a trap. I got lost once because of my own fault but luckily, I managed to find my way back, thanks to Sarah! And also thanks to our RAs, Harbin and Mamat for taking care of us in the field. They help us to carry heavy stuff and even help to lift us up when we have the difficulty to go up the hill since the track is steep and slippery. Without them, we won’t survive in the forest. They are really amazing because they know all the points without even referring to map or GPS. They can even carry heavy stuff while walking uphill like it was nothing. They even clear the tracks to make it easier for us to walk. I respect and salute them!</p><p>I can’t forget the memories of riding the car to go to field. It was a bumpy ride but the scenery is breathtaking. It’s just like heaven on Earth. I was fascinated by the beauty of the nature. Although, some part of the forest has been taken over by the oil palm plantation, which is a disappointment to me. And the forest is full of leeches so prepare your leech socks before going in! I received many “love bite” from the leeches but I don’t even care anymore because the more you care, the more difficult for you to walk. So most of the time I just ignore them, I just assumed that I am doing a blood donation to the wildlife.</p><p>Some of the researcher we met at SAFE; Sarah L., Alice, Rajeev, Anand, Tehri, Takeshi, Stephen and Anne. They are really nice people and easy to get along with. Really miss them. Learnt a lot from them since they have a lot of experience. At first,I thought they were really serious since they are researcher but it turns out that I’m totally wrong! They are fun, friendly, outgoing and funny people! Not forgetting our beloved boss, Sarah M. who has taught us a lot since day one. She is very nice to us and taught us not only how to do her work but also some life advice. Couldn’t ask for better boss! And also to all the RAs and staff there, they are all friendly and good people. I really glad to know them all.</p><p>Really gain a lot of experience during this volunteering. Hopefully in the future, I can have the opportunity to come back SAFE to do my own research, which is the study of mammals. This is one of the best semester breaks I have ever had!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2014-08-24-09.25.56-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2014-08-11-11.14.14-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2014-08-11-11.25.151-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'>"

Never regret to come to SAFE!!! I really like SAFE!!!</p><p>Actually I am a Johor-ian who actually lives far from Sabah. It was actually hard for me to sacrifice my holiday where I can spend time with my family, friends, enjoying the relaxing moment. However, I took up this volunteer job when I was offered by Dr. Kalsum, lecturer of Universiti Malaysia Sabah as I always want to try new things and live in a real jungle which I never tried it before. Luckily, my friend Leona joined me in this trip, or else I would be alone for the 10 hours ++ journey to Tawau by bus and another 3 hours ++ bumpy journey by four-wheeled to reach SAFE. The first staff I met is our driver, Magat who is actually a nice guy and a skilful driver. We are supposed to call him after we arrived at Tawau bus station but he actually approached us afore we call by seeing my bag which has UMS wording on it. Haha! Quite smart of him isn’t it?</p><p>Upon reaching SAFE campsite, it was 9.30p.m.  The first people who talked to us was Anne, batwoman (hope she won’t angry when know about this). She brought us to meet other researcher and our boss, Sarah Maunsell a.k.a Sarah Moth. It is the start of our one month living at SAFE on 23July 2014. The following day, we started our field work with Sarah. The first day we went into fragment E, and it was challenging to me as I never actually went into a forest which is that steep, full of thorn plants, muddy, and Last but not least, LEECHES!!!! After the first day, both of us suffered from muscle pain but we did get better for the following day.. During the field work, we learned how to set the light trap. Besides field work, we helped Sarah in some lab works such as sorting, pinning, and labelling which luckily we have learned in our U. We saw many different species of moths which are new for us. We also learned how the micro moth is pinned and labelled. This is also new for us. All the moths that are pinned is put into a collection box which eventually becoming a small “moth museum”.</p><p>During the field work, we actually got lost sometime. However, our hero – RAs will come to save us. We actually worked with three RAs – Harbin, Matiew and Mamat. Honestly, I like Harbin more J But, every RAs is good. They know the route of the forest, help us to carry heavy stuff, clear the route for us, always pay attention on us whether we can follow their pace and even lift us up when the route is steep. Besides them, many RAs treat us well and they are friendly, invite us to play sport with them and teach us how to play pool. As for the cooking staff, they always cooked delicious food for us and even teach us how to cook dessert. Initially, I thought the food in forest is not nice and I even bought junk food and Maggi but eventually, I have donated to forest rat.</p><p>Besides RAs, we met researchers from different country and specialize in different field. Anne, Sarah Luke, Alice, Rajeev, Stephen, Takeshi, Anand, Tehri, Rory and Robert. They are nice people and always share their life experience with us. Especially our boss Sarah M., she is a beautiful and confident women, damn funny and cute. She can laugh over a small thing and I like her laugh. We thought she is serious but she is actually nice to get along with, treat us well and we always gossip with her. She is just like our peer. She is cool as she is a boxer! She is so nice and treat us flight ticket back to Kota Kinabalu from Tawau. Anne is another researcher who left me a deep impression as she always keen to learn Malay. She always brought her own notebook along with dictionary, asked me and Leona many vocabulary. She even learned Malay song from Leona. We also went to a field work with Stephen once and it was fun actually. He is a funny guy! He taught us how to use special devices. He is handsome. We made him a special card to remember our friendship. Another funny guy in SAFE is Ryan. He is one of the manager but we like to talk with him as he is a good story teller. I like to listen to his story and life experience. He likes to eat chilli and he actually made the sauce by himself. He cooked nice food. We are surprise there is actually a guy who likes to plant orchid. He knows how to play guitar, sing “Sayang Kinabalu” and speaks Malay fluently. I am glad to know all these amazing people in SAFE.</p><p>Actually, SAFE campsite have many facilities and not as terrible as what we initially thought. Toilet, bathroom and bedroom are all well prepared. There are television and WIFI for entertainment. Besides that, volleyball and badminton court is prepared for sport activities. There is a river behind campsite where you can wash clothes or swim in the pool at the upstream. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are prepared every day and sometime snacks will be prepared for tea break. The weather is nice and the view is breathtaking. The sky is blue in the morning; at night, it was like galaxy on your head, many stars twinkling and meteor can be seen. In the morning, it is windy and at night, it is cold. Leona and I enjoy sleeping and the food in SAFE. For us, it was like vacation during this one month.</p><p>SAFE is doing project on altered forest. Besides the beautiful scenery of the natural, we also saw many logged forest. It is quite sad when we saw the tree fall down and the land become bald. It reminds us as conservation biology student, we have to do something to reduce the impact towards the natural.</p><p>There are many memorable experiences for me in SAFE. The first leech bite I got during my twenty one year lifetime. I really hate leech! This is the only thing that I still cannot let go. Besides that, the field work of fragment D was the most challenging task. The forest there was steep and the soil is loose which you are difficult to stable when standing. Harbin even lifted me up where the hill was too difficult to climb up to. However, eventually I managed to survive from this difficult task. I feel proud of myself! Besides fragment D, the grass of fragment C which taller than us left many scratches on our hand. I got a chance to climb up the weather tower but I only managed to climb to second level as I was tired after field work. The bumpy but exciting route every time we have to pass through whenever we went to field work. I have tried rambutan hutan which I really like its sourness and its texture, rambu jambutan hutan and I even ate palm fruit which is quite oily. I was surprised to see the freshly plucked mushroom from the forest! It even with roots attached on it! I always like to sleep on the hammock which is in the kitchen. It is nice to relax on the hammock, watching the blue sky and doing nothing the whole day!</p><p>I hope I can come back to SAFE again! I want to go to Maliau Basin, want to eat durian there and want to climb to the top of the weather tower! I want to go to VJR! This is a wonderful and meaningful semester break I ever have! Thanks to SAFE!  </p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2014-08-24-09.11.56-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2014-08-24-16.56.07-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2014-08-24-09.25.56-300x225.jpg' width='300' height='225'>"

Alice lives next door to me in the camp. If you work with bats, you do not get to see your colleagues very often, but you do see amazing sunrises, stunning views of misty valleys and the VJR mountain while driving to far away study sites and, if you are lucky, you get to see as many as 35 bats of up to seven different species in one night!</p><p>I am investigating the resilience and virus ecology of Bornean bats in the framework of my PhD. My goal is to find out if bat populations differ in their level of stress, immunocompetence and viral prevalence according to different degrees of human disturbances. Therefore, I am comparing bats living in undisturbed areas (LFE) and fragments (B,C & F) before, during and after the logging.</p><p>My work includes setting up to 5 harp traps (PICTURE 1) per night. This demanding work can only be accomplished with the help of the RAs who are an indispensable asset to the team! Around 7:30 pm and 7:30 am we check the traps for captured bats. You never know what you will find in there – sometimes the traps are empty, you may discover ant or dung beetle invasions or even huge moths. But satisfyingly, there are often bats in the traps, one, two or in an extraordinary lucky night up to 18 in one single trap! In this case, it seemed that a huge part of the resident Hipposiderus cervinus colony got captured: all individuals were of the same species: adult males, females and juveniles (PICTURE 2). At the trap, I quickly check if the bats are still growing or pregnant/ lactating females, in which case I release them immediately. The other bats travel with us to the camp, where I am taking measurements on the body condition (length of forearm and weight) as well as oral, urine swabs and fecal samples. All individuals are banded with a unique number so we can recognize the animals upon recapture (Picture 3). Bats of the family Rhinolophidae donate part of their blood which will be used to assess immunological parameters and the level of chronic stress. Next time we check the traps, the previous bats are released at their capture site. Some fly off immediately, others, that lowered their body temperature to save energy, need some time to prepare for the energy costly process of flying.</p><p>By working at night you experience a totally different aspect of the rain forest. The sounds of day active birds is shifted to the shrilling voice of cicadas, the red eyes of fire flies  seem to surround you and often you would see wildlife which rarely occurs at daytime. At trap position 6 in C, I encountered a porcupine which, after first going back in the depth of the forest, checked 5 minutes later if I was still there. On the road to F, civets frequently cross the road. Deers and bearded pigs quickly escape from the headlights, while porcupines take it easy and enjoy a catwalk in the bright light of the car.</p><p>So far, I worked in LFE, F and C and processed 170 bats of 15 different species already. Today, I am off to B and I am excited, which animals in, around or on the way to the traps await me tonight!

35,"2014-08-08","blog8-110x110.jpg","Adventures in thermal photography","","<p>My PhD research focuses on microclimate at the SAFE Project. This means that I am interested in the climatic conditions – such as air temperature and relative humidity – found within the forest and oil palm plantations that we study here at SAFE. Last summer, during my first field season, I set up a large network of sensors to monitor microclimate continuously. In my office at Imperial College London I have been using this data to help construct a physical model of microclimate.</p><p>My model works by simulating how sunlight shining upon the vegetation canopy acts to heat up the air found within and below the canopy. As sunlight enters the forest at the top of the canopy, a large fraction of it is absorbed by the leaves and this absorption heats up the leaves. The increase in temperature of the leaves also causes air that is contact with the leaves to warm. Similarly, any solar radiation that penetrates the forest canopy and reaches the ground is absorbed by the soil, which heats the soil surface and, in turn, warms the air in contact with the ground. This process, combined with subsequent movement and mixing of the air, governs the pattern of air temperature observed within the forest. Therefore, while my model is primarily concerned with predicting the air temperature, it also produces predictions of the temperature of leaves and the soil surface.</p><p>As part of my second field season at SAFE, I wanted to collect data on leaf and soil surface temperatures to check if my model is making accurate predictions. To do this, I have been using a thermal imaging camera to take hundreds of images from below, within and above the vegetation canopy in the forest and oil palm plantations.</p><p>This first pair of images shows the same area of forest at 9.30am and then at 12.50pm. The tree trunks, leaves and the forest floor can be seen to have increased in temperature by 3-4°C on average during this time. The leaves are warmer than the tree trunks, which is not surprising as the leaves contain pigments that absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, and also the leaves are oriented so as to intercept sunlight, unlike the trunks.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_6.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_7.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><p>Aside from learning about the rate at which vegetation heats up throughout the day, my images have given me information on the spatial variation of vegetation temperature. The image below shows that leaves on neighbouring trees can differ in temperature by as much as 5°C depending on whether or not they are exposed to direct sunlight. Such significant variations over small distances could have important implications for the microclimate within the forest canopy.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_11.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_12.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><p>This image shows a road running through an oil palm plantation. The road surface is considerably hotter than the surrounding vegetation. As there is no plant material shading the road, the surface is exposed to all of the incoming sunlight and so it heats up rapidly during the day. The hot road surface then heats the air immediately above it. You can very clearly feel this heat when walking along the roads at the SAFE Project, as compared to when walking in the relatively cool air of the forest. When roads are built through forest, a warm channel of air is created along with the road and this air can penetrate into the neighbouring forest. Increased temperatures are observed within forest adjacent to the road, and this can affect species living within the forest at distances as great as 50m from the road.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_15.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><p>While out photographing the vegetation I have also been able to get close enough to some wild animals to get images of them. Some examples included here are a warm-blooded bearded pig and a cold-blooded tree crab, which are both at different temperatures to their surroundings. These were photographed close to the main SAFE camp.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_19.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Adventures_in_thermal_photography_20.jpeg' width='320' height='240'><p>Upon my return to London I will begin the detailed processing of the hundreds of images I have taken while at SAFE, with the aim of verifying the output of my microclimate model. I hope that besides this, some of the images may lead to other interesting findings about the thermal environment in tropical forests.</p>"

When I started my PhD research in 2011, camp was many hammocks cramped under layers of fragile tarp and a cosy, inseparable work and dining area. For a phone call we would climb a hill, stream ‘0m’ was a dream of a bathing spot (less during flooding though) and daily exposure to Korean drama ensured us that life at SAFE wasn’t so bad after all. For a rare moment of privacy, I would run to where today a saw mill turns magnificent trees into sheets of plywood. Back then, there was no traffic, no heavy machinery and no roadsite settlements. Despite past logging, the area had remained a local hotspot for wildlife. I would frequently marvel at orangutans and encounters with clouded leopards would make any sacrifice forgotten. While the prospect of spectacular wildlife sightings was my driving force of motivation, it was the wonderful support of the SAFE team that made an epic journey a truly memorable adventure. Each staff member has contributed to my work in some crucial way for which I express my gratitude, my friends Roy and Mamat deserve a special mentioning for their great assistance over the last three years.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/Farewell_to_Timm_Dobert_3.jpeg' width='532' height='400'>"

I am interested with the sampling design of SAFE project and decided to choose it as my study site.  I went to the SAFE campsite together with my dearest supervisor, Dr Kalsum and lovely friends, Chua Wanji and Pang Li Man on the 2nd of July 2013.</p><p>My study is focusing on the effects of forest fragmentation on the species composition of canopy and leaf litter ant communitiess. I use the fogging (for canopy sampling) and winkler (for leaf litter sampling) techniques. The fogging required eight big circular trays and that was too big for a 143cm tall person like me to carry, but the RAs were very nice and helped me to carry my gear into the field. I will compare my sampling result with the previous research.</p><p>Everyday (except Sundays and public holidays) I struggled to wake up as early as 3.30am because we have to arrive at the sampling site before 7am. I worked in Block C and the journey took almost took two hours. It was not so easy for me to wake up that early since it was very cold there and sometimes I could not even sleep very well because my body shaking too much due to the cold temperature. Once we arrived at the block, we needed to walk around 30 minutes from the parked car to the sampling site, brushed ourselves with the dewdrop and trying to get rid of the leeches. I did my sampling for leaf litter first by measuring a 1mx1m square quadrat and also the thickness of the leaf litter before collecting it into a pillow-case. After that we hung the collecting hoops and started fogging the area. Then we had to wait for two hours before we could collect the bottles below the collecting hoops.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/DSCN4718-574x400.jpg' width='574' height='400'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/DSCN4741-600x391.jpg' width='600' height='391'><p>Raining in the early morning hurt me so much because I cannot go out to sampling. The fogging does not working in wet condition as the fallen insects may stick on the leaves. What makes things worse was it has been nonstop raining for about 3-4 days.  The RA, Mainus helped me to sort the millions of insect and arthropod in fogging bottle. I am so thankful that a microscope was provided at camp so that I could sort the insects there. By looking at the large number of insects and arthropods that we collected, I certainly felt like giving up sometimes and the alcohol smell is not good either. As this is my first time doing individual sampling, I made a lot of mistakes, but gained a lot of experiences and was able to improve my collecting and recording methods.</p><p>Personally, I am very fascinated seeing the wildlife that live around the camp site with my own eyes. This study area gave me the opportunity to enjoy nature with threatened species of mammals, such as the orangutan.  One afternoon there was a female orangutan making its nest on top of the tree near the riverbank just opposite to the campsite.  I also saw another two orangutan at different locations, one with a very big-sized body and the other we saw still sleeping on the tree just near the road. I wonder where they will go once the whole area is turned into an oil palm plantation? As some of the experimental area will be conserved as fragments, they may move to these areas but I am afraid these areas will become overcrowded with mammals. I hope not, so I can do my sampling without disturbing them or them disturbing me.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/DSCN4745-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/DSCN4760-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>Anyway I enjoyed conducting my sampling at the SAFE project and I really wish that I can make my second sampling this coming November!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/1370391_10201396294301512_1594947051_n-2-180x400.jpg' width='180' height='400'>"
240,"2013-12-26","059-150x150.jpg","Climbing the Virgin Jungle Reserve","","<p>By Jack Thorley</p><p>The final mission of the year for mammal team of the SAFE project was not camera-trapping or live-trapping. Therefore we chose to accept it. The plan was to ascend to the highest point in the ‘SAFE’ landscape, to the summit of the virgin jungle reserve- the VJR. At 950m, its shares height with Mt Snowdon, and so reaching to the top although not too arduous a challenge, only a handful of people will have done so previously. Why so? The steepness of the slopes are a prime deterrent for logging, a factor which was no doubt important in its classification as a VJR in the mid-20th century, a title which safeguards it from logging of any kind. Secondly, there are bigger peaks on the horizon, so if metres climbed are your incentive, you would look elsewhere. Perhaps the occasional gaharu- (a wood sold for its incense-like qualities) or deer-hunter pick their way through the dense vegetation from time to time, but otherwise this meant venturing into an untouched parcel of Bornean forest.</p><p>The Ascent</p><p>With only a sketchy trail for guidance, the climb was a game of thorns. The plants in the tropics have long battled the voracious appetites of their herbivorous consumers, an arms race that has granted the flora an impressive arsenal of toxins and spines [or even mutualisms with that most loyal and fearsome defender, the ant]. Against such weaponry, the path up started as a slow and frustrating affair. To rub formic acid into our rapidly accumulating wounds, the noisy tread of hiking boot on leaf litter and parang (local knife) on bush meant that seeing animals would rely on them being geriatric. Miraculously, these doubts were quelled as half way into our climb, a confetti-fall of leaves and a rustling from the canopy signalled the arrival of a gibbon troop. Typically, gibbons stay in groups of 2 or 3. Yet, as these masters of brachiation boisterously crashed through treetops with such aplomb – the guile of a trapeze artist combined with the machismo of a matador- it became apparent that there were 6 individuals in this group. Long, fluid swings of the arm, a leap across a leafy void, a tight-rope walker’s shimmy along a branch. Each as bloody minded as the last as they bundle on. It may be some of Mr Wearn’s grade-A tripe, but gibbons are supposed “to have some the fastest healing bones in the animal kingdom”- it was pretty evident why.</p><p>Jaw back in place, we began to approach the summit. The trees began to shrink, mosses began to appear, and scattered about us were pitcher plants, the first I had seen since coming to Borneo. Adept in poor soils, getting their nutrients from the insects they unwittingly trap in their bulbous bottoms, these evolutionary marvels managed to distract us somewhat from the narrowing, spongy ledges we were traversing. Fortunately, the density of the plants shielded from view the precarious drops below, until eventually, after about four and a half hours, we clambered up to the rocky outcrop that that formed the peak, and the panorama that had alluded us all the way up appeared- the views were spectacular. Oil palm plantations with lone mengaris trees (their wood is poor and locals believe that each have a ghost and so they are not felled) and rainforest, the distinction between the two melting away from focus into one green sea, clouds gathering along the valleys like the foaming of the Oceans. To the East was the true Sea. To the South, the towering uplands of the Bornean interior. A lot of the SAFE site was visible from this vantage; criss-crossed through the foreground red dirt tracks snaked through the emerald. The logging and clear-felling that would fragment the area into remnant patches of forest and form the backbone of this enormous experiment is well and truly under way.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/061.jpg' width='225' height='300'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/059.jpg' width='225' height='300'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/dsc_0839.jpg' width='640' height='426'><p>Just off the edge of our lofty ridge was hirundine heaven; swallows and swifts acrobatically carved through the air, chattering incessantly against a backdrop of blue. Their limelight was to be short-lived, as left of centre, two Black Eagles effortlessly soared into view, the true size and majesty of these birds only appreciable when their enormous wings brought them close to the cliff-face, diving in and out of each other on invisible thermals. The trip was shaping up nicely, but we were hungry. It was time for dinner- alas, noodles on the stove. (I forgot to mention we would be camping overnight…)</p><p>The Evening</p><p>After dinner, it was twilight. Venus already burned brightly to South, and stars were awaiting the arrival of the full moon. If there is one thing ‘team mammal’ has been reasonably successful at in the past few months, it was night walks, with sitings of clouded leopard, flying foxes, flying squirrels… the works. We would have to wait a while before this evening’s night walk though, as the moon was starting to cross the horizon. The moon which has been an object of mystery and even worship for millennia, its allure as strong as the gravitational pull that keeps it forever bound to the Earth. Perched on high, it was our turn to be hypnotised by its beauty, as the chirrups of cicadas and crickets rose up from far below. Through binoculars, pock marks speckle its surface, a sign of collisions long past. All seemed to be going far too well to this point, so the night walk was doomed to fail before we even picked up a torch.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/dsc02060.jpg' width='640' height='853'><p>I will gloss over the night walk, as it did indeed fail. We stumbled upon a stick insect, but the mammals that live at these higher altitudes evaded us. Not a shiny eye in sight. Camera traps are more patient than humans anyway, so maybe in future this small area can be properly explored. Ultimately, if it wasn’t for me nearly head-butting this snake [below] on the climb back up to bed- I say bed, I mean stone pile- if really would have been a poor show. On the morrow’!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/dsc02037.jpg' width='640' height='480'><p>(I haven’t had a chance to ID it yet but looks like a type of tree snake)</p><p>The morning </p><p>In the morning we awoke from our rock-softened sleep before sunrise, so that we could watch sunrise. As if envied by the spectacle afforded us by its smaller brother the moon the previous eve, the entrance of the sun was magnificent; gradations of red, orange and blue coalescing to frame the soufflé clouds hugging distant mountains. No sooner had the sun arrived, the swallows were back on the wing, and the first chainsaw crowed. We cooked porridge and sat on our favourite crag, dubbed ‘Por-ridge’, to watch and listen to the broccoli-floret forest as it clicked into day-mode. As the shadows cast by the emergent giants shortened, the dawn chorus of Bornean gibbons bubbled away, interposed by the blood-curling bark of muntjac and the solitary mew on an orang-utan. There were three separate bands of gibbons leading this territorial orchestra, the members of one being visible to us as pin-pricks bustling beneath us, perhaps the same do-gooders we had seen the previous afternoon. The two eagles, this time much lower in the sky, had returned to scour the forest for a morsel.</p><p>We watched this natural play unfolding in the relative safety of the VJR for an hour or two, set in stark contrast to the  logging trucks snaking through thinning forests just beyond.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/219.jpg' width='640' height='480'><p>As we left the mountaintop, I returned to the trig point that had been ‘heli-ed’ into position on the “20-02-1958”, circled by rhododendrons, bracken and woody shrubs. Etched onto its surface were the names of people and small groups that had also had the fortune to experience this place. There were only five or six messages over these 50 years. This place, assuredly untouched by humans, whilst all around it chainsaws whirled and lorries spluttered, had certainly touched me. And if you were to return to the same spot over the next few years, much of the forest will have split into a patchwork enveloped by oil palm. In this instance, the destruction is serving a worthy goal in the pursuit of science; what was the value of this lost land for biodiversity and the functions provided therein. Yet, there is of course another value shared by scientists that work in such environments, a much deeper, aesthetic value that drives them to question, to comprehend, and to conserve. The emotion felt when seeing eagles at their level, when sharing the forest with the gibbons only entrenches these values further. I was back at the bottom again. With tired legs I dropped into the back of the land rover and headed back to camp, leaving the mountain to stand alone once more.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/068.jpg' width='640' height='480'>"
70,"2013-10-26","R2-150x150.jpg","All Creatures Great and Small","","<p>As a Biodiversity Hotspot, Borneo has been put on the map mainly for its wild animals and plants. In celebration and recognition we tend to turn chiefly to the charismatic megafauna: your orang-utans, pygmy elephants, sun bears and the island’s eight stunning hornbill species.</p><p>As an early-career conservationist, I am far from immune from the charms of these animals and naturally delight in any evidence of them during my time in the field at SAFE: an orang-utan’s used nest, the discarded fruits from the tree it has fed from, the footprints of a bearded pig in the mud or a glimpse of a crested fireback through tangled forest undergrowth. These encounters are infrequent treats, but even more everyday birds like bulbuls and sunbirds are generally heard but not seen.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/CIMG3135-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>What has struck me, however, is the utter ease with which the wealth of spectacular invertebrate, rather than vertebrate, life can be enjoyed. You don’t need the keen eyes of a birder or ranger to see some fascinating and thoroughly exotic creatures whilst in the SAFE forest, often right at your feet.</p><p>I have been collecting data for my MSc thesis, looking at partitioning seed removal rates between smaller vertebrates, such as mice, tree shrews or birds, and invertebrates, such as ants. I hope to see if there is a change in overall seed removal rate as well as a shift in the dynamics of the roles played by these groups when compared across primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation sites and if so, begin to explore why this may be happening. Discovering how basic process patterns are changing could have real implications for the biodiversity in these forests. This project is one of many building up a bigger picture of the forest ecosystem at SAFE, and how this is going to be affected long-term by fragmentation.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/CIMG4030-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>In terms of equipment, I have been using different types of exclosure; basically these are little structures which are designed to keep certain things out and let other things in. I leave seeds out overnight and measure what has been taken overnight as a way of figuring this out. This has entailed, through my trial experiments, grovelling about in the leaf litter and disturbing this microhabitat in the name of science. The side effect? An intimate acquaintance with Borneo’s bug world. Hammerhead flatworms glide, glistening, over and under the crisp leaf litter. Ants, orders of magnitude apart in size difference, exploit all kinds of forest resources- seeds, insect carrion and sap from Macaranga plants. Enormous, multi-hued butterflies as big as birds sleepily flap about in the sticky air while stick insects stand stock-still, spotted only by the keen eyes of my RA (Research Assistant).</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/CIMG2937-300x400.jpg' width='300' height='400'><p>One of my main limitations when first negotiating my way around the forest with my RA was my lack of what is termed by some as ‘forest feet’; that is, my sense of balance along with confidence in firmly planting each foot in new, uneven and often downright slippery spots. It felt as though I have some kind of encounter with a new species every day in the field, and the more confident my footfall grew, the better able I was to look around me when getting from A to B.</p><p>My days have not been as gruelling as some of the other researchers, although I still found them pretty tiring. We left camp at the standard time of 8.00am, following a refreshing wake up at the new camp of chilly air! One of my logged forest fragments, D, was much closer to the new temporary camp up by the logged forest edge; but on the flip side driving to the oil palm was much further away, adding to already hefty daily journey. The RAs I have worked with most are Mus and Harbin, who thankfully insist on shouldering much of my bulky equipment into the forest.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/CIMG3919-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>I’ve loved my time at SAFE and cannot wait to answer a few questions with the data I collected – and whether or not I come back here, I’ve learned huge amounts about both running a research project, as well as boosted respect for the spectacular invertebrates of this shrinking tropical habitat.</p><p>For more information on Rosa’s project click here.</p><p></p>"
240,"2013-09-22","W-field-150x150.jpg","Camp Life","","<p>“ You sure you are going to do this?” Mom was not convinced. She thought I must be insane to be leaving my holiday and the city behind to stay for a fortnight in the wild. Well, it turned out to be almost three weeks and it exposed me to a new level of nature which I’ve never before experience in my 22 years of living.</p><p>I was lucky to have my project supervisor, Dr. Kalsum with me for the first few days. Without her constant guidance, reminders and motivation, I would have curled into a ball and be consumed by camp-shock. Don’t get me wrong, I have joined a couple of camping trips but when the mind is also burdened with the thoughts of a major project, stress made things trickier.</p><p>For instance, Dr. Kalsum was very kind and patient in helping me to construct the glass grid needed to measure the herbivory rate on Macaranga leaves. I didn’t realise that until then I had taken the availability and access to lab equipment for granted. Everything seems to be sterilised and ready to use in school laboratories. It opened my eyes on what researchers have to go through to prepare their tools for field work. We had to draw 1cm x 1cm grids on the clear glass pane by hand, after we had cleaned it and sealed off all the sharp sides with cellophane tape.  Instead of grumbling about the monotony of the task, I’m grateful we had a glass pane at all!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/W-grid-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>The 15m Riparian Zone was my first and last field trip during my stay. I have to admit that it was the most pleasant hike compared to other forested sites. The running stream has a soothing effect on me and the hike was light and easy. Almost every spot by the water would make a perfect spot for picnic and Maria packed good snacks.</p><p>Talking about food, early August proved to be a marvellous time to visit because it coincided with the celebration of Raya. Of course all the staff including Research Assistants (RA) got their days off in conjunction with the huge Muslim festival. We had to tend to ourselves and couldn’t get out to field on those days but when they came back, we had a great open house. This translated to free flow of amazing Malay delicacies and cookies for the day.</p><p>When I wasn’t eating, I was mostly sleeping, working on my samples or collecting samples in the field. I went to Virgin Jungle Reserve (VJR) and only got five samples instead of the fifteen needed from each site. What a disappointment! The hike into VJR was very difficult and though we stopped at all four plots in the area, the yield was still so little. I could practically hear my heart beating in my ear so you could imagine how exhausting the hike was. One cool discovery was a small snake I saw in my path. The feeling of spotting a live wild snake was incredible, although its length and size were comparable to those of a long earthworm.</p><p>During that particular hike, I was constantly scratching my neck, as it had become inflamed and irritated. Later, back in camp it broke out in a rash. The next morning I woke up very early intending to go to VJR again to settle my unfinished business, but small red bumps had risen to fill my neck area in a dense manner making me moody and unwell. Those nasty patches craved the hard scratch of my fingernails, a desire I resisted with all my strength. Later I showed it to Sarah, Maria and the young cook, Yen, only to be told that it might be caterpillar or some toxic plant.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/W-rash-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>I was very fortunate to be assisted by Mus, the RA for all my trips out to the field. He was a good climber and that was a bonus in getting samples from very tall trees. Some Macaranga trees can grow very tall and the mature trees tend to have their branches concentrated at the top. Branches with a hollow centre which hosted the Crematogaster ants were the samples I needed.</p><p>There was one night where I woke up worried and confused, as the generator was turned on and everything was pitched black. I was lying there, taking in all sounds of my surrounding to check if it was raining. There were some dripping sounds which I at first thought, and sort of hoped to be the beginnings of a heavy downpour but the discreet tip-tapping did not increase in frequency. I heard Dr. Kalsum move around in her hammock and asked if she thought it was raining. She said NO. Satisfied with her answer, I mustered up courage to check the kitchen and found Amy cooking in the dark. I got ready at the speed of light.</p><p>I tagged along on Amy’s field-trips and she followed me on mine. Sometimes we went our own way but we love each others’ company. That day during our morning ride, we saw three elegant deer with spots galloping across the road right in front of our jeep. The road was so dark and the creatures were illuminated by the vehicle’s headlights. Their movement was swift and within a fraction of a minute, they were completely out of sight and into the forest. Yet, the image of them galloping midair had been carved into my mind like a picture. It was like a scene from Disney’s ‘Snow White’ and it was a beautiful sight.</p><p>The day before I was due to go back Sarah invited us to tag along as she went out to do her task.  There was room in the car since she took only one RA, Matthew with her to change the batteries for a data logger at the transpiration experiment, as well as some other small tools.</p><p>We gladly agreed and it was an enjoyable trip. We hiked up an extremely steep hill which fortunately wasn’t very high. It was fun and challenging but I doubted my own stamina if the hike were to be a longer one. In the heart of Kuala Lumpur where I grew up, the most walking I did was on the smooth tiled floors of shopping complexes. Out on the streets, I inhaled a lot of vehicles exhaust fumes, I cross super busy roads and always on the lookout for pickpockets and bag snatchers. Streetlights are in abundance in the city, so I get to do at night what I do in the day.</p><p>At SAFE, we stepped on uneven dirt ground, which became slippery with the rain. I crossed all kind of running water and was on the lookout for leeches, caterpillar, bugs and some poisonous plants. Everywhere I go, I breathed in lungfuls of fresh air and it was a nice change. I learned that one can answer nature’s call in the nature and many electronic gadgets don’t really play a big role in our life. Simplicity is the key of living and I didn’t miss them at all in the trip.</p><p>One of the highlights of my visit to SAFE was climbing up the Carbon Flux Tower. If you ever get the chance to do it, do not ever turn it down (providing it’s not raining). The view from the top is breathtaking and the climb up the 50 meters shaky ladders presented me with an adventure that I thought only possible in movies!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/W-field-600x326.jpg' width='600' height='326'>"
83,"2013-08-23","vjrSA-150x150.jpg","Sun Bears and Pitcher Plants","","<p>Stephen Hardwick is a PhD student at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College London.</p><p>                   I am a physicist by training and my main research interest here at SAFE is the climate. This means that I don’t spend my days crashing through the forest in direct pursuit of the many charming and fascinating species found on Borneo. And as such, a lot of the most exciting moments during my field campaign have been incidental to my work rather than central to it; a group of elephants blocking the road on our way back to camp; a glimpsed sighting of an orangutan while setting up my equipment; hornbills noisily flapping overhead as I collect a soil sample. However, from time to time I enjoy thrilling field days as a direct consequence of my research needs. One such day occurred last week, when I embarked on a genuine adventure into some of the less explored forests at the heart of the Brantian Tantulit Virgin Jungle Reserve. My mission: to scale the rocky peak at the centre of the reserve and reach the highest point in the SAFE project site!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/vjr1-600x400.jpg' width='600' height='400'><p>                For the first year of my PhD I have been working on modelling the local microclimate at the SAFE project site. One interesting result from my model is associated with the relationship between air temperature and altitude. It is well known that the air gets cooler at higher altitudes; that’s why temperatures at the summit of the famous Mount Kinabalu are near freezing despite it being only six degrees north of the equator and surrounded by lush tropical forests. I am interested in a subtler relationship than this; that of the variation in diurnal temperature range – that is the difference between the highest temperature and the lowest temperature on any given day – and altitude. My simulations suggest that in this part of Borneo there is a much greater variation in temperatures throughout the day at lower altitudes than at higher altitudes. Therefore, as part of my fieldwork I am trying to collect data to verify this relationship.</p><p>                     All of which means that I need to collect data on climate over a wide a range of altitudes, hence my goal of climbing to the highest point in the project site. With the help of Roy and Alex, two of the excellent SAFE project research assistants, and a GPS loaded with a local contour map, I struck off into the Brantian Tantulit Reserve. In addition, I brought along sixteen small microclimate sensors to place in the forest to monitor climatic conditions. These relatively inexpensive devices each contain a memory chip, so they can be left out in the field for long periods of time to merrily log the air temperature and relative humidity at regular intervals.</p><p>                    Just a few metres from the road I halt our small expedition to install my first microclimate sensor. According to the GPS we are at an altitude of 285m. The contour map suggests that the summit is at an elevation of over 900m, which means there should be a big enough range in altitude during the ascent for me to get the data I need. The first hour is fairly slow going as we make a steep climb up to around 500m, stopping after every 50m in altitude change to allow me to set up another sensor. Up to this point we have been following a well-established trail that is used to gain access to some of the frequently used sampling points in the reserve.</p><p>                  Beyond the 500m mark however, there is no coloured flagging tape showing a route to the summit; instead, we must make our own trail. This task I leave to Roy and Alex, who have far greater experience of the forest here than I do. Roy leads the way, clutching the GPS in one hand and swinging his parang – a machete – with the other to clear a path. I follow on, monitoring the altitude with a separate GPS unit and Alex is behind me, marking out our progress so that I can find my sensors again in the future. Not long after leaving the already existing trail, we come across a tree with its lower trunk covered in deep claw marks. Prominent gouges like these can only mean one thing; a sun bear. The sun bear is the smallest member of the bear family and is the only species of bear found on Borneo. Sun bear sightings are pretty rare here at the SAFE project, although not unheard of, and today we are not lucky enough to see the animal itself, but it’s good to know they inhabit the forests we work in.</p><p>                  After three hours of hiking we have reached the top of a ridge at an altitude of 650m. Unusually for the forests around here I can feel a cooling breeze steadily pushing through the trees and to the west we can see out over nearby oil palm plantations. We stop for lunch next to an old tree stump that has long ago had the name “ROSMAN” carved into it; an enigmatic message from someone who has ventured into these parts before us.</p><p>                        As we push on up towards the peak it is like drifting back in time to visit the SAFE project site in its natural, unaltered state. Most of the jungle here has been selectively logged twice; once in the 1970s and again between 2001 and 2008. This means all of the largest and most commercially valuable trees have been felled and sold. The Brantian Tantulit reserve has itself been lightly logged near its fringes, but here in its core, where the steep topography and lack of roads have made it impractical for any timber to be harvested, there are a few truly giant trees towering over the surrounding valleys. As we clamber over their immense roots, Roy identifies a couple of the mightiest specimens as Shorea faguetiana – the world’s tallest tropical tree species. The record-holding individual stands at 88.3 metres tall and is a resident at the nearby Tawau Hills National Park.</p><p>                  Once we make our way past an altitude of 850m there is a remarkably sudden change in the forest around us. The large dipterocarps that had surrounded us lower down the mountain are replaced by much shorter and scrubbier vegetation and much more sunlight reaches the surface. There are exposed rock surfaces partially carpeted by thick, spongy layers of moss and upon which are perched a number of pitcher plants (Nepenthes). These carnivorous plants trap insects in their tube-shaped leaves using a viscous, sticky fluid that prevents prey from escaping once they have fallen in.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/IMG_4710-266x400.jpg' width='266' height='400'><p>               Finally, after a five hour ascent, we emerge onto the bare rock of the summit. To our surprise, standing astride the peak like a Wellsian martian is a tall, three-legged metal marker. Despite the remoteness of this point, we are clearly not the first people to have been here. Indeed, graffiti etched onto the marker shows that the summit was visited multiple times in the 70s and 80s, with the earliest message reading “Fred Dzen 2/77”. Once I have set up my sixteenth and final microclimate sensor, I spend a few minutes enjoying the magnificent views afforded us from the mountaintop. To the south, we can see the ocean, with uninterrupted oil palm plantations covering the intervening 30km; and to the northeast lies the main SAFE project experimental site. It is with some sadness that I gaze out over the site, as I realise that perhaps myself, Roy and Alex will be the last people to look out over the valley and see it in its current, fully forested state. The conversion of the majority of the SAFE project site to oil palm has started now, and before long most of the forest here will be gone.</p><p>                  Despite the inevitable drenching from an afternoon rainstorm that we receive during the descent, we arrive back at camp in high spirits after our exciting expedition. I will be returning to collect the first few weeks’ worth of data from my sensors before I leave the SAFE project site to return to the UK. But even after I am gone my sensors will remain to stoically monitor the climate on the mountainside. I hope that now a trail has been established future visitors to SAFE will be able to enjoy the hike and the views from the peak. And maybe on their way up they can retrieve my data for me!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/vjrSA-600x400.jpg' width='600' height='400'><p>For more on Stephen’s projects at SAFE see here.</p>"

I want to try and find out what happens to invertebrates – including insects, crabs, shrimps and snails – when forest around a stream is chopped down and oil palm plantations are planted. Do they still survive and do they still do the same jobs that they did before, or does everything change when a forest river becomes an oil palm river?</p><p>To work out what’s there we use nets and traps to catch different invertebrates in different environments within the stream. Insect larvae – including mayflies, dragonflies, stoneflies and many others – are found on the rocks and in the sediment. If you disturb the sediment and ‘wash’ the rocks with your hands, you can catch the larvae in a Surber sampler net (see photos below) as they escape downstream. If you tip the net contents into white plastic tray you can see the larvae swimming around, and pick them up using forceps or a pipette.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/S1.png' width='475' height='356'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/S2.png' width='474' height='356'><p>Adult ‘dragons’ can be caught using a butterfly net. On hot sunny days dragonflies and damselflies will be very active – flying over the stream searching for mates, food or fighting rivals, or will be sunning themselves on rocks or overhanging vegetation. A swoosh of a net can get them, and if you hold them by the wings they can’t escape whilst you photograph and record them.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/s3.png' width='492' height='369'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/s4.png' width='492' height='369'><p>All the streams in Sabah have large numbers of surface-skating bugs from the family Gerridae. They skate on top of the water, facing upstream to catch dead or dying insects that are being washed down. They are easy to see and can be caught using hand nets.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/s5-360x400.png' width='360' height='400'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/s6-531x400.png' width='531' height='400'><p>The streams also have lots of crabs, shrimps and snails, but they’re harder to spot than the insects. To catch them we use bottle traps each made from a water bottle that has had the top cut off and inverted inside the base to create a funnel-like entrance. We add fish or bread bait to entice crabs, shrimps and snails and wedge the traps in pools under rocks where we think invertebrates might be foraging. Many of these larger invertebrate foragers are more active at night, so we leave the traps out overnight and return the next day to see what we’ve caught.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/s7-299x400.png' width='299' height='400'><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/s8-299x400.png' width='299' height='400'><p>All the collections are made at specific points within a 200m transect, and the same methods are followed at every stream. Also, multiple collections are made on different days to try to account for differences – such as weather – that might affect collections but that you can’t control. Using controlled methods like this ensures that you make fair comparisons between different streams, and so any differences in what you collect should be down to differences in streams, rather than differences in the effort that you’ve put in.</p><p>Invertebrates are small and it is often impossible to identify them reliably in the field – you need to be able to look at them under the microscope to see their features fully, or in some cases, dissect them to have a look at internal organs to be sure of correct identification. It’s crucial to be able to identify the invertebrates correctly if we are to learn about the communities in the streams. Therefore unfortunately, all invertebrates caught must be killed and preserved to allow for later identification. This is done using ethanol, acetone, or freezing. Invertebrates are highly abundant in streams and so the numbers taken for this project make up a very small percentage of the total population. Taking these individuals will cause no harm to the persistence of the populations but will give us a much better understanding of the ecosystem, how it is affected by the change from forest to oil palm, and therefore how best to protect stream systems.</p>"

We’d catch frogs in our hands, water boatmen in nets, and – the best thing – caught minnows in bottle traps baited with bread. If you’d asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up, I think I would have said that, and I think everyone would have laughed.  However, amazingly, here I am 15 years later – still pond dipping! I’m doing a PhD at the SAFE Project studying the impacts of forest logging and oil palm plantations on invertebrate communities in streams, and investigating ways to conserve stream ecosystems. I’m very lucky to have been able to swap cold English canals for warm tropical forest streams, and I’m doing my best to try and answer questions about biodiversity, and conservation in a changing world.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/SL.jpg' width='400' height='260'><p>(Photos- Claudia Gray)</p><p>Tropical rainforest streams are not very well studied so it’s important to see what species are found there, and also – because more and more forest is being logged around the world – how species are affected by changes in land use around streams.  When forest around streams is chopped down streams experience big changes in sediment, nutrient, pollutant and wood inputs from the land, as well as changes in water flow, and temperature because of lack of tree shade.  In Malaysia large areas of forest are being cleared to plant oil palm plantations. Whilst this is bringing huge growth to the economy and is providing jobs for many people, it’s also having large negative effects on natural ecosystems. If we want to try and protect the amazing biodiversity of the region it’s important to understand what’s there, what the impacts of forest logging and oil palm plantations are, and if steps can be taken make oil palm agriculture more sustainable.</p><p>To look at the impacts of logging and oil palm on stream ecosystems I’ve chosen to focus on invertebrates – animals without backbones, such as insects and crustaceans – because they are highly diverse and they play very important roles in stream ecosystems.  This includes breaking down organic material such as leaves, and providing abundant food for other groups including fish and frogs.  I’m studying adult dragonflies, crabs, shrimps, snails, insect larvae and pond-skater insects.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/SL2.jpg' width='400' height='376'><p>(Photos- Sarah Luke)</p><p>So what happens to all these invertebrates when forest around a stream is chopped down and oil palm plantations are planted?

Or does everything change when a forest river becomes an oil palm river?</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/SL3.jpg' width='400' height='151'><p>(Photos- Sarah Luke)</p><p>I started my PhD in 2012, and will be completing at least three field seasons at SAFE. I’ll keep posting about what I’m doing, the methods I’m using, and what I find whilst I’m pond dipping!I’m trying to answer these questions at the SAFE Project. To do this I collect invertebrates and measure environmental conditions across different streams surrounded by forest or oil palm.  The streams are similar sizes and types, but vary according to how much forest they still have surrounding them, and how high quality that forest is. I collect invertebrates using the same methods at every stream. Once I’ve collected the specimens they are killed and preserved, and later identified and counted.  Having information about the number of different species, the identities of the species, the number of individuals as well as the environmental conditions in which I found them means that I can try to understand what is found where and what conditions different species live in. Therefore, I can try to work out the impact of forest logging on the stream invertebrate community.</p><p>I started my PhD in 2012, and will be completing at least three field seasons at SAFE.

27,"2013-02-16","3-150x150.jpg","Mosquitoes, Tarsiers and Porcupines: The Night-Time Wanderings of Eagle-Eye Hayley","","<p>I awoke to a convoy of 4x4s leaving the campsite, the steady hum of the chainsaw and a group of gibbons calling. Seemed like today would be like any other mosquito collection day; a morning and afternoon of rigorous lab-work before finally making my way to the forest at 4pm. Snakes or mammals (once a marbled cat!) often cross the muddy roads during our drive out to the plot, but today we were not so lucky. I slung my backpack over my shoulder and began the hour walk to the site; through thick, scrubby forest. It was not long before my research assistant (Harbin) spotted a male orangutan in a nearby tree. We watched for a few minutes whilst the orangutan kiss-squeaked unhappily at us, before continuing to our plot.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/1-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>The trail to our plot…Could be mistaken for a scene out of Jurassic Park (minus the dinosaurs of course…..)</p><p>We cut our way through the sea of ferns, rattan and leech filled grasses before finally reaching the furthest plot in fragment E (a future 10 hectare fragment). Our shelter was already up from the last two nights of sampling, so we just sit down on the chairs and prepare cups to place collected mosquitoes in (one cup for each hour we work). At 5.30pm we started exposing our legs to the mosquitoes, using a method known as human landing catches (HLC). Red-light head-torches help us to spot any mosquitoes which land and these are sucked up using a pooter before they have time to bite.  From the pooter, which looks like a big straw, our captures are transferred to the relevant cup. The two of us sit there collecting for six hours (a dull task when mosquito numbers are low!) and finally euthanize our collection before heading back to camp. We keep ourselves entertained by listening to music, teaching each other Malay or English words, and Harbin sometimes whistles to attract birds. He has perfected one whistle and had two birds of the same species fly closer to him to investigate!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>Harbin fixing the shelter we sit under during sampling</p><p>At 11.30pm, we packed up the shelter, picked up our chairs and began our walk out. Suddenly Harbin stopped, he had spied a small animal hugging a near-by tree and, taking a closer look, we were amazed to see a Western Tarsier!! Unlike most nocturnal mammals, tarsiers do not emit eye shine when light hits them and this makes them pretty impossible to spot. I was able to get really close, almost close enough to touch it. It turned its head straight towards me with its large eyes, and posed perfectly for the camera. After a few minutes it got fed up of me and turning its head around freakishly (almost 360°), it leaped onto another branch and away into the forest.</p><p>As we continued to walk out, I saw movement in the trees next to me. It was another tarsier!! I just smiled at this one as it jumped from tree to tree and then disappeared. We also met with two common porcupines and a number of different frog species on our way back to the road and heard bearded pigs grunting their way through the scrub. It had definitely been an amazing night for wildlife spotting, probably the best field day I’ve ever had….closely followed by the day I spotted  the Slow Loris!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/3-300x400.jpg' width='300' height='400'><p>Western Tarsier</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/41-533x400.jpg' width='533' height='400'><p>Fully engorged female Anopheles mosquito (hopefully not full of our blood!)</p>"
240,"2013-01-11","catchingdragons-150x150.jpg","Into the wild with orang utans, leeches and dragonflies: Volunteering with SAFE in Sabah, Borneo","","<p>I had never seen so much oil palm in my life.</p><p>Greeted with the sight as my plane landed in Tawau airport, the ride to Tawau town centre and throughout the 3-hour long journey from town to the SAFE campsite, I never went without seeing vast plantations of oil palm. But this is the reason why SAFE exists and why researchers from all over the world and in different fields congregate here in an ulu (Malay for isolated) tent-village in the middle of a logged forest. There I was too, on a volunteer stint in the monsoon month of December.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/tentvillage.jpg' width='456' height='340'><p>The SAFE temporary campsite is a tent-village!</p><p>I had the opportunity of volunteering with various projects that went on while I was there. The action started early the first morning as we trudged up the campsite river with an RA team. In my Adidas Kampungs (literally, village football shoes) that were a size too big, I followed the nervous RA (Mainus) who found my precarious hopping and balancing over rocks and logs a little too unsettling. Though thoughroughly leech-bitten by the time we reached our destination, the hydrology station, we went on to do our fieldwork unfazed. Readings from the hydrology data logger were taken and a flow-rate experiment was conducted.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/riverwalk.jpg' width='437' height='584'><p>The hike upstream… our destination: the hydrology station</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/flowrate.jpg' width='437' height='584'><p>Measuring the flow rate of a river stretch</p><p>I was impressed by how vegetation surveys were conducted like clockwork. There was one RA designated for each step of the way: 1. mark tree, 2. map tree, 3. measure dbh, 4. record tree properties, 5. collect leaves. As one of the core projects of SAFE, knowing the general density, age and species composition of trees in each plot is extremely useful base information for the other projects going on; since vegetation affects the fauna that exist in an area. Some of the faunal surveys that were being carried out were mammalian and mosquito surveys, in which I had the privilege of meeting the dedicated scientists running these projects. Having a gander at camera trap photos of the large diversity of mammals (eg. Malayan Pangolin, Malayan Sun Bear, Clouded Leopard, Bay cat, Moon Rat) that still exist in the logged forests was heartening and disheartening at the same time, knowing that they will have to move or die when it is eventually converted to plantations!</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/vegsurveys.jpg' width='485' height='542'><p>Vegetation surveys are conducted like clockwork</p><p>Moments of my childhood were relived catching dragonflies in a plantation stream as part of a river macroinvertebrate survey. With a large hand net in my flailing arms and striking with an inexperienced aim, I managed to catch some really spectacular looking ones. They came in bright red, pink, navy blue, neon patterned, jet black and many other forms. It is surprising that such a diversity of dragonflies still exist in a highly disturbed oil palm stream.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/catchingdragons.jpg' width='587' height='438'><p>Catching dragonflies for a macroinvertebrate study in an oil palm plantation stream</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/caughtdragons.jpg' width='587' height='299'><p>Two species of dragonflies out of the many that were caught!</p><p>Apart from the experience that I gained from helping out in the various projects, I witnessed many animals for the first time! From the sight of the distinct honking calls of the Rhinoceros Hornbills to bathing in the river with a family of three wild Orang Utans in the vicinity, they were all priceless experiences that I will never forget. The highlight of the trip, however, came as a fleeting moment on my last day. Whilst sitting atop of a slope listening for gibbon calls for a primate project, I witnessed a barking deer in a half hop-run coming up towards me. I watched in awe as the sounds of another animal’s movements grew louder – it was chasing the deer! It sped off in the opposite direction as soon as it saw me and all I got was a split-second’s look at it’s back. A solid-coloured cat barely the size of the muntjac with a thick, long bushy tail to boot. The extremely rare bay cat perhaps?</p><p>Exciting experiences aside, the everyday sight of boundless plantations served as a constant reminder of the problem. In my head, every palm tree represents a person on earth. The growing demand for palm oil fueled by the growing human population and consumption is taking away the forests and rich wildlife. It’s a monumental problem for environmentalists in Asia to surmount and communication of the issues at hand is key to create awareness among the public. I must remember to talk to others about it when I can. I’m glad to have been part of SAFE and I look forward to the data that comes out of it.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/loggedforpalmoil.jpg' width='652' height='487'><p>Once forests, these lands have been logged to make way for oil palm plantations</p>"
240,"2012-12-04","2012-11-26-11.56.32-150x150.jpg","Squirrels, terrapins and belly button leeches","","<p>We had frog legs for dinner in Tawau, which were surprisingly juicy, before Min took us out to the tent city that passes for the SAFE Project ‘field centre’.  On the road out there we passed a guy walking through the plantation with a pack of dogs and a spear, and then had my best ever view of a leopard cat.</p><p>The camp was pretty empty because most of the staff were at Maliau, competing in the annual Maliau Carnival.  Min had been confidently predicting success for our team in the orienteering, and he wasn’t wrong.  Our guys got almost twice the points of the next best team.  On top of that, Maria won Queen of the Dinner because of her bling, Sabri won the arm wrestle, we came third in the tug of war, runner-up in the karaoke and I don’t know how we did at badminton and funny football (everyone dressed up as a girl and kicking a pilates ball).</p><p>The first full day of ‘work’ was a camp day for most of the staff, which meant for an unlucky few that Johnny put them to work clearing out all the drainage paths running through camp.</p><p>Hayley came back to the camp from a week in isolation in the oil palm plantation sites.  She’s been doing human landing captures for mosquitoes, using Zinin as bait.  The reason she’s so happy is that on one night she caught 150 mozzies buzzing around the poor guy.  I’m not sure if Zinin’s as happy about it as Haley is.</p><p>A few days in and we went small mammal trapping with Ollie which was pretty cool, even for an entomologist like me.  We caught tree shrews and squirrels and many kinds of rats, harassed them, scanned them, injected ID tags into them, weighed them, measured them and finally released them.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2012-11-26-11.56.32-533x400.jpg' width='292' height='207'><p>While checking the traps I saw, or rather heard, a bizarre thing. There was what can be best described as a synchronised rattling in the background, which Ollie drew my attention to. It was ants, living inside the hollow stem of a rattan, and bashing the wall with their heads in synchrony to warn us off. An astonishing noise, for its decibel level as well as for its incredible method of generation.</p><p>Jamil showed up one night out of the blue, wanting to fix one of the hydrology stations that got washed out in a flood, so I followed him out to see how they do it.  We saw red leaf monkeys on the way, which was great.  They’re gorgeous creatures, bright red fur, even brighter than the orange orang utans, and lithe little bodies with evil faces that look a bit like the mask from Scream.  There were two adults, one of whom was pregnant, and a baby, and they sat on the trunk of a snapped off tree before elegantly swinging into the lianas below and out of sight.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2012-11-27-10.49.41-150x150.jpg' width='150' height='150'><p>The hydrology station is nothing earth-shattering, but neat to see them pound in the stakes to hold the sensors, with all the cables held in a pipe leading to the datalogger that records everything, and finally the pipe getting covered in boulders and cemented in place.  The sensors are recording stream depth, water temperature and turbidity every couple of minutes.Day 7:  Feeling bold and adventurous, I went out with Min, Ling and Opong to watch them work.  We went into the LFE sites, pushing north into the Ulu Segama Reserve.  Several of the sites were by rivers or streams, and I noticed as I absent mindedly tossed a leech into the water that it was eaten within seconds.  Massive predation pressure in those little bits of water.  Coming out along the river I had another surprise.  Opong noticed and hand caught a small terrapin in the stream, and when we let it swim away it swam right into the path of another one.  When I asked Opong about it more, it turns out most of our streams have these cute little turtles in them.  I had no idea…</p><p>I also noticed something that’s probably been around me forever, but just gone without me seeing it.  There were a heap of ants stuck to the bottoms of leaves with the zombie fungus spearing out from their dead bodies.  It’s something I’ve heard of but never seen, and it’s really quite impressive.  The fungi can extend three or four times the length of the ant body, and I don’t think I saw two fungi that were the same.  Once I started noticing them they seemed quite common; I saw five or six in the very small areas that I sat down in and just looked around me.</p><img src='/safe_web/static/images/blog_legacy/2012-11-28-16.44.091-533x400.jpg' width='330' height='246'><p>Bloody leeches</p><p>The wildlife was pretty good today.  We saw monkeys, probably long-tailed macaques, on the way in, orang utan mother with baby on the way out, as well as the terrapins and even a juvenile white-fronted water snake in the stream.  Unfortunately, though, I don’t think I’ve ever been so heavily leeched.  I felt one plop inside my trousers in the field and sure enough he’d somehow gotten in, had his fill and dropped off.  An equally fat one rolled out of my trouser leg at the end of the day, and yet another fat one dropped out of my waistband when I went for a pee.  And I picked two out of my belly button but didn’t notice the third, right at the end of the day and which bled for hours.In the evening Ollie decided to go on a night drive, collecting data on a different set of mammals that we don’t see during the day.  It was all a bit of a farce, really, with hardly anything out and about in the full moon.  We did see a slow loris, which I was excited about, having never seen one before, but it was quite a distance away and if Ollie hadn’t been there to tell me what it was then I wouldn’t have known.  Beyond that, we saw eyeshine of what was probably a flying squirrel, we saw a civet streak across the road in front of us, and we saw a samba deer hidden in long grass.  A poor showing for a couple of hours on the back of a Land Rover.</p><p>then it was back to Tawau and civilisation.  Washing in a shower instead of a stream, the positive joy of a desperately needed washing machine, and as much cold beer as you can handle.  It’s great, for a while.  Can’t wait to go back to the forest though.</p>"
