Despite their huge size wild elephants are elusive, spending much of their time deep in the forests feeding on young palm and bamboo shoots and fresh leaves. In areas recently converted from forest to agricultural land herds of elephants cause great damage to crops and fruit orchards in their search for food, especially bananas. Elephants may spend up to 14–19 hrs a day feeding, during which they may consume up to 150 kg of wet weight. They defecate about 16–18 times a day, producing about 100 kg of dung. Dung also helps disperse germinating seeds. They are also a premier “flagship species” and are sometimes regarded as a “keystone species” because of their important ecological role and impact on the environment.
Females are generally docile, but large males can be aggressive. Males have tusks up to 1.5 metres long. They are active by day and night, and are able swimmers.
The life span of Asian elephants is 60 to 70 years, and males reach sexual maturity at between 10–15 years of age; females usually first give birth in years 15 or 16.

The fur is black sprinkled with brown or grey on the tips of the hairs. The long whiskers, the ear tufts, and sometimes the face are white. They are nocturnal and excellent climbers. 
They belong to the same family as other small carnivores including Civets, Genets, Mongooses and Fossa and share a number of characteristics with them including a long snout and having more teeth than most other carnivorous mammals. Like other members of the Civet family, the Binturong has scent glands which are located just under it’s tail. These glands are used to mark trees and foliage to outline an individual’s territory and is distributed whilst the Binturong is moving about. Oddly enough, the odour of this scent is said to smell like popcorn as are Binturong cubs when they are newborn. Until they became stronger and are more aware of their surroundings, young Binturong are incredibly vulnerable and are able to spray foul smelling liquid (like a Skunk) when they are really frightened.

The fur colour of the Bornean Gibbon is typically grey-brown, though this can vary greatly. The brow is pale cream to white.
Gibbons are exclusively diurnal and arboreal, and rearly descend to the ground. They travel mostly in trees by swinging from branch to branch via brachiation. This mode of locomotion involves extending their long arms over their head in order to hook their hands onto branches.  They are able to cover three meters in a single swing and around 850 meters per day. Bornean gibbons walk upright with hands over head for balance when walking on the ground, although they do not cover long distances in this fashion. They are not good swimmers and avoid open water.
Gibbons are monogamous and occur in small family groups generally comprising a male, female and their young. Most gibbons produce offspring every 2 to 3 years. Nursing may last as long as two years.

It is nocturnal and terrestrial in habit. It rests in a tree during the day until dusk when it leaves in search of food. They feed on fish, frogs and crustaceans near streams, as well as bats and small birds. Sharp spicules on the underside of its toes enables the owl to grab on to slippery fish. While silent flight is a hallmark of owls’ mastery of nocturnal hunting, the buffy fish owl and its relatives have actually lost the soft fringes that are found along the rear edge of the wing feathers in other owl species, which enables owls to fly without making a single sound. Since fishes don’t pick up airborne sounds very well, there is little need for the buffy fish owl to conceal the sound of its approach as it swoops in for the kill.
Buffy fish owls do not build their own nests, but rather use the abandoned nests of other birds or a tree cavity. The female lays one egg, which hatches approximately one month later.

It is a closed canopy species that is never seen on ground. It is one of the largest species of squirrel in the world. The head and back of the body varies from dark brown to gray, and the belly varies from dark yellow to white. The ears are short and round. The adult squirrel’s head and body is from 322 to 350 millimetres (12.7 to 14 in) in length, and the tail is 373 to 438 millimetres (14.7 to 17.2 in) long, with an overall length of 695 to 788 millimetres (27.4 to 31.0 in); the weight is between 929 to 1,575 grams (2.05 to 3.47 lb).
This species is diurnal, but mainly active during morning and evening. They live either in pairs or alone. Unlike other tree squirrels, the cream-coloured giant squirrel does not sit upright with its tail arched over its back while feeding; instead, it balances itself with its hind feet on a branch so that its hands are free to control its food. In this position the axis of the squirrels body is held at right angles to the support, with its head and forequarters on one side of the branch, and the tail as a counterweight on the other side.

One of the most unusual of all bird species, males are unmistakable with massive primary, secondary and tail feathers. The face is blue, the crown is black with a distinctive short crest. The upperparts are brown, finely mottled with buff; iridescent ocelli can be found on the wings and tail. The wings can continue to grow until the bird reaches its sixth year. They are amongst the largest of all pheasants measuring up to 6.5 feet (~2m) in length. A. a. grayi is slightly smaller than A. a. argus and can be distingiused by the burnt orange on the breast and neck and with more white spotting. Females are similar, but smaller than males; also lack the ornate tail and wings.
The Great Argus’s breeding display is remarkable.  The male clears an open spot in the forest and prepares a dancing ground. He announces himself with loud calls to attract females, then he dances before her with his wings spread into two enormous fans, revealing the hundred of flashy “eye-spots” eyes.
The Great Argus is monogamous. They reach sexual maturity in three years. The Great argus produce two to four eggs per year.

This tortoise is the largest inhabiting Asia, and the fourth largest in the world. It has a carapace length of up to 50 cm and a weight of approximately 20kg.
The tortoise’s forelimbs have five large claws and are covered on the front with large, heavy, overlapping scales. By contrast, the hindlimbs end in four pointed claws and bare a conspicuous cluster of very large tubercular scales on the thigh either side of the tail. These are so large that the species is sometimes referred to as the six-footed tortoise. It spends most of the warmer parts of the day soaking in pools or in the shade, out of the sun’s rays.
The Asian tortoise is unique among turtles and tortoises in building a nest on the surface of the ground, and in providing maternal protection of the eggs. For a few days before laying, the female gathers up leaves and debris into a mound on which to place her clutch. Unlike most tortoises, which use their hindlimbs to excavate nest sites, Asian tortoises use their forelimbs to ‘backsweep’ surface leaf-litter. Reported clutch sizes in captivity range from 21 to 53 eggs, which the female then covers with vegetation and guards, frequently piling more vegetation on top. If the eggs are threatened by a potential predator, the female will first attempt to drive them away by pushing and biting, but if this fails, she then defends the eggs by sprawling her body over them.

It is a medium sized monkey with a long, non-prehensile tail. It has grey-tipped, dark brown or black fur, giving it a uniform silvery appearance. A crest of fur runs along the top of the head, and the hair on the cheeks is long, often obscuring the ears. The hands and feet are hairless, with dark coloured skin, and have opposable thumbs and toes. Silvery lutings are diurnal, and travel in groups of around 9-40 individuals with one adult male and many adult females communally caring for infants. Females remain in the group for life, while males leave shortly after reaching adulthood, living in small groups of their own until they can take over an established harem. Within the group, males dominate the females, and females with young dominate those without. Like other langurs, the silvery lutung has a large three-chambered stomach to digest the cellulose found in its herbivorous diet.
Females range from 46 to 51 centimetres (18 to 20 in) in head-body length, with an average weight of 5.7 kilograms (13 lb) and a tail length of 67 to 75 centimetres (26 to 30 in). Males are slightly larger, from 50 to 58 centimetres (20 to 23 in) in length, with an average weight of 6.6 kilograms (15 lb) and a tail length of 67 to 75 centimetres (26 to 30 in). 
Silvery lutungs breed year round, with no clear breeding season, although each female typically gives birth no more than once every 18 to 24 months.[8] The female attracts the male by making side-to-side motions with her head, and copulation may occur several times during a bout. Unusually, females have been reported to reach menopause in the wild, and may survive up to nine years after last giving birth. 
The female gives birth to a single young after a gestation period of 181 to 200 days. The young weigh about 400 grams (14 oz), measure about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) and are well developed, with a strong grip for holding onto the mother. Silvery lutungs are born with orange fur, and with white hairless skin on the face, hands, and feet. The skin rapidly changes to the dark adult colour, but the fur does not reach the adult pattern for three to five months after birth. The young are cared for by females communally, and are not weaned for 18 months, even though the biological mother stops lactating after just 12 months.[9] The young are sexually mature almost as soon as they finish weaning, and, on average, females first give birth at 35 months of age.","Brunei Darussalam; Indonesia; Malaysia.","A variety of primary and secondary forest types, including riverine, mangrove, swamp, montane and coastal.

They produce a similar range of vocalisations to the domestic cat. Leopard cats are about the size of a domestic cat, but more slender with longer legs and well-defined webs between the toes. Their small head is marked with two prominent dark stripes, their short and narrow muzzle white. There are two dark stripes running from the eyes to the ears, and smaller white streaks running from the eyes to the nose. The backs of their moderately long and rounded ears are black with a central white spot. Body and limbs are marked with black spots of varying size and color, and along the back are two to four rows of elongated spots. The tail is about half the size of their head-body-length and spotted with a few indistinct rings near the black tip. leopard cats weigh 0.55 to 3.8 kg (1.2 to 8.4 lb), have a head-body-length of 38.8 to 66 cm (15.3 to 26 in) with a 17.2 to 31 cm (6.8 to 12 in) long tail.
There is no fixed breeding period in the southern part of its range; in the colder northern range they tend to breed around March or April, when the weather is mild enough to support newborn kittens.
After a gestation period of 60–70 days, two to four kittens are born in a den, where they remain until they are a month old. The kittens weigh about 75 to 130 grams (2.6 to 4.6 oz) at birth and usually double their weight by age of two weeks. The eyes open at ten days, and the kittens start to eat solid food at 23 days.

In their forest home, mouse deer travel along paths which resemble tunnels of thick vegetation leading to resting places and feeding areas. Males are very territorial and they regularly mark their territories with scent glands found under their chins.
Female mouse deer may give birth to a single fawn at any time of year. Like other hoofed animals, newborn fawns are precocial and stand within thirty minutes of being born. The does wean their fawns at around twelve weeks. The fawns can breed at five to six months, and may live for twelve years.
Sang kancil (pronounced: Kahn-cheel), the diminutive but wise mouse deer, holds a place of pride in Malay and Indonesian folklore. The tiny hero is cunning and intelligent, and able to prevail over larger tyrants and foes.

They have pinkish-brown faces and the fur on their heads sweeps back over their forehead, often creating a crest of hair on the top of their heads. Males have mustaches and cheek whiskers that frame their faces while females have beards as well as cheek whiskers. Both males and females have white coloration on the eyelids near the nose. The defining characteristic, for which they are named, is their extraordinarily long tail that is almost always longer than their height from head to rump, and ranges in length between 400 and 655 mm (1.31 and 2.15 ft). These macaques are primarily arboreal and can leap distances between trees up to five meters.
Long-tailed macaques sleep in trees along the river and are particular about choosing their roosting sites. Each group sleeps in its own tree and individuals huddle together when they sleep to maintain body temperature. They sleep toward the edge of the branches near the top or crown of the tree and preferentially choose branches that overhang the river. Long-tailed macaques are excellent swimmers, and this may be a predator avoidance technique: if they are threatened, they simply can escape by dropping to the water and swimming to safe.
Reproductive output is linked to dominance status among female long-tailed macaques. Sexual maturity in females is reached at four years of age, males at 7. About 80% of the infants born into a long-tailed macaque group are sired by the alpha male.

A potential related issue is the release of confiscated long-tailed macaques from the border area of Viet Nam and China (which is where most of the current international trade is being recorded) into the native range of other macaque species. In the Philippines, the species is subject to a high level of hunting, where it is taken for local consumption and hunted for sport. It is also persecuted as a pest.

Prices have escalated since 1990 meaning on the international market in some areas people will pay US$95/kg .","http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3394/3559639422_dd14fd9dfa.jpg","http://www.flickr.com/photos/kwokwai76/3559639422/","Pangolin hiding behind a tree by kwokwai76, on Flickr","http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=manis+javanica&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunda_pangolin","http://eol.org/pages/337659/overview","http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/12763/0","http://www.arkive.org/sunda-pangolin/manis-javanica/","http://data.gbif.org/species/5219628/"
38,"Varanus salvator","Water Monitor Lizard","Least Concern","unknown","commonly seen",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"Monitor lizards have long, slender, muscular bodies with a narrow head, long neck and well developed legs equipped with long toes and claws. They also have a long, powerful, sideways compressed tail which has a keel on the top to assist with swimming. The tail can be up to 1½ times its body length. They can grow up to a maximum weight of 50kg but most will only reach half this size.
They are typically an amphibious animal which swims confidently over long distances and has the ability to stay under water for 30 minutes. This lizard is active during the day and will often spend the night in water.
Their colouration is either drab grey, dark brown or olive with yellow or white spots. These spots can be arranged in circles giving the appearance of strips across its back. The colour varies with age and sub species. 
They are not territorial but can be very aggressive and will use their tail and jaw when fighting. They live solitarily and the young are extremely secretive and rarely seen.","Found in Sri Lanka, India, Indochina, Indonesia and Malay Peninsula.","Inhabits a variety of natural habitats but most important are mangrove vegetation, swamp and wetlands all at altitude of less than 1000m. Also observed in agricultural areas and cities with canal systems.","They are extreme carnivores and will eat almost anything. Diet consists of birds and their eggs, small mammals (rats, monkeys and squirrels), fish, lizards, frogs, snakes, crocodile eggs and juveniles.","","They are hunted for their skin (leather trade), meat and fat which is used in traditional medicine.","http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2302/2174650322_fcf24be9ba.jpg","http://www.flickr.com/photos/keithkelly/2174650322/","Monitor Lizard (Varanus Salvator) by Keith Kelly, on Flickr","http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=varanus+salvator&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_monitor","http://eol.org/pages/1055072/overview","http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/178214/0","http://www.arkive.org/asian-water-monitor-lizard/varanus-salvator/","http://data.gbif.org/species/2470685/"
39,"Martes flavigula","Yellow Throated Marten","Least Concern","stable","commonly seen",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"An Asian species of marten that is a medium sized carnivore related to the otter and weasel. They are fearless, agile and fast moving and primarily diurnal. However, they are sometimes said to be largely or entirely nocturnal as they will hunt at night and increase their nocturnal activity during lunar nights (this is ±7 days around the full moon). They hunt mostly on the ground but are perfectly capable of climbing trees.
Distinguished by their bright and attractive colouration, a mixture of black, white, golden-yellow and brown, their fur is relatively short and has a strong odour. The head is small with a pointed muzzle and round ears and the body is elongated with hind limbs that are more muscular than the forelimbs, the tail is long and thick and can be more than half its body length. 
They live in groups of 2-3 or on occasions have been seen in groups of 5-7 but this is rare. Their litter sizes will be up to five young and gestation is for 220-290 days. They have a lifespan of approximately 14 years. ","Native to countries in South-east Asia including India, China, Thailand, Borneo, Cambodia and Indonesia.","Primary and secondary lowland and montane forests less that 3000m, type of habitat can vary depending on the region they are from.","Primarily a carnivore but does have omnivorous tendencies, food items include squirrels, birds, snakes and lizards, insects, frogs, eggs, fruit, nectar and berries, will also eat honey and bees giving it a very extensive diet.","","There are no significant threats at the population level. However they are tied to forest areas and hunted heavily for their fur in Siberia and Korea, this is not a global threat. They are easily habituated to humans and not afraid to take waste from bins, this could make them easy targets and to become classified as a pest.","http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8470/8131293314_15d81edce4.jpg","http://www.flickr.com/photos/maxime-passionzoos/8131293314/","Martre à gorge jaune de Sibérie (Martes flavigula aterrima) by Maxime Thué, on Flickr","http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&q=martes+flavigula&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C5&as_sdtp=","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-throated_marten","http://eol.org/pages/311513/overview","http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41649/0","http://www.arkive.org/yellow-throated-marten/martes-flavigula/","http://data.gbif.org/species/5218844/"
