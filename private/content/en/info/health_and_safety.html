<p>We contracted an independent consultant to conduct a risk assessment for working at the SAFE Project field sites. A short summary of the key risks can be found {{=A('here', _href=URL('wiki', 'wikiwikiwiki'))}}, but we recommend you read the {{=A('full risk assessment', _href=URL('static','images/core_science/safe_ra_2011.pdf'))}} which can be used as a basis for your own risk assessments. Note that this does not include an assessment of any specific risks that are associated with the particulars of your research activities.</p>

<p>There is also an {{=A('Emergency Response Manual', _href=URL('static','images/core_science/safe_manual_complete.pdf'))}} for the field sites. The manual provides clear written protocols and flow charts on how to respond to emergency situations. There is a hard copy of this manual in the field camp, and all researchers are advised to read it.</p>

<p>A list of {{=A('emergency contact numbers', _href=URL('static','images/core_science/emergency_contact_numbers.pdf'))}} has been prepared, including the phone numbers of key staff, research stations, hospitals, police and helicopter evacuation service.</p>

<p>In the event of an emergency, there is a well-stocked first aid kit at the campsite and most of the SAFE Project staff are trained in emergency first aid and field rescue techniques. There are two satellite phones for emergency use. One is located at the SAFE Project field site and the other in a satellite field camp located in the logged forest control sites (LF).</p>

<p>Any safety incidents or near misses that you experience while working at the SAFE Project should be reported using the {{=A('Incident Report Form', _href=URL('static','images/core_science/safe_incident_report_form.pdf'))}}. This is to help us further refine our protocols to ensure the highest levels of safety for all staff and researchers.</p>
