{{=H2('Logistics and costs')}}

<p>You will need to think carefully about the logistics of your research at SAFE: make clear plans for when you need to be at different sites and budget for field costs. You will need to budget for:</p>

<UL> 
<LI>transport, </LI>
<LI>accomodation, food and admin costs, and</LI>
<LI>research assistant support.</LI>
</UL>

<p>The charges below apply to scientists, students, overseas volunteers, external research assistants, project supervisors and scientists/students on planning visits. For projects requiring extensive vehicle or research assistant use please email the {{=A('Deputy Coordinator', _href='mailto:deputy.coord@safeproject.net')}} for special rates.</p>

<p><strong>Note that all charges are subject to change without notice.</strong></p>

{{=H3('Transport')}}

<p>The core research areas in the SAFE project are split between two locations: the experimental and cleared areas at SAFE and the old growth forest sites at the Maliau Basin Conservation Area. Within Maliau, the sites are most easily accessed on foot, but at SAFE the distances involved often mean you will need transport to and from sites.</p>

<p>The SAFE Project can provide both transfers between sites and transport around the experimental area, using our fleet of four Land Rover Defender 110 and three Ford Ranger 2.2 XLT. These vehicles are driven by our trained and experienced staff and for safety reasons, may not be driven by anyone else, unless under emergency circumstances. Exceptions may be granted for long-term researchers with formal training in off-road driving.</p>

{{=H4('Transfers')}}

<p>Pick-up and drop-offs from Tawau town or Tawau airport can be arranged on Sundays, when there is minimal fieldwork, or on a weekday subjected to availability of vehicles and drivers and at the discretion of Scientific Coordinator.  Requests made less than one week prior to pick up may not be entertained.  Email the Deputy Scientific Coordinator to arrange a pick-up.</p>

<p>Because of the distances and the nature of the roads involved, we strongly discourage anyone from requesting same-day return trips to and from Maliau.  Same-day return trips between Tawau and SAFE are possible.  Transfers between Tawau, SAFE field camp and Maliau Basin Studies Centre are charged at the same rates as those charged by SEARRP at Danum Valley, which can be found here.</p>

{{=H4('Transport around the SAFE Project experimental area')}}

<p>Due to high demand and the large extent of the SAFE Project area, most researchers get drop-off and pick-ups at designated points and times, or share vehicle if they are working at nearby areas.  We charge RM 100 per hour for these services -- this is charged per person, regardless of the number of occupants in the vehicle.  Note that if the vehicle needs to drop you off, return to camp and then come out to pick you up in the afternoon, you will be charged for the full amount of time the vehicle is on the road.</p>

<p>The following examples indicate the the average time/cost to most field sites, although timings can be greatly affected by road conditions:</p>

{{=H3('Accommodation, food and admin costs')}}

{{=H4('SAFE experimental area')}}

<p>Within the experimental area, the SAFE project has built a field camp with beds, cooking and toilet facilities, and is powered by generator in the evening.  We do not charge any fees for using this camp, and we also provide basic camp and office facilities like electricity, laser printing, scanning, satellite TV, etc.  We do charge a to cover food and cooking costs that applies to researchers staying at SAFE and at Maliau, payable to the Scientific Coordinator at the campsite.</p>

{{=H4('Maliau Basin')}}

<p>Researchers at Maliau Basin typically stay in rooms in the Scientists' Annex or dormitories in the  Hostel. Food is provided at on-site cafeteria, although you may be able to self-cater by prior arrangement. You will also need to pay access and admin fees to work at Maliau Basin. The charges are shown below -- the Royal Society SEARRP can usually provide a letter of support for SAFE Project researchers that allows you to qualify for the discounted rate.</p>

{{=H3('Research assistants')}}

<p>Lone working is not permitted for Health and Safety reasons.  We require all new researchers and field workers to take one of our Research Assistants to familiarise themselves with the locations of study sites and trails.  At the discretion of the Scientific Coordinator, researchers working in pairs or with their own volunteers are able to work without SAFE Project Research Assistants.  Rates for Research Assistants are the same as those charged by SEARRP at Danum Valley. Working at night (6 pm -- 6 am) incurs a 50% surcharge and if trained RAs are required to provide canopy access or rigging than a 100% surcharge is applied to cover safety equipment replacement and maintenance.</p>
