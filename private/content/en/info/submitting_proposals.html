{{=H2('Submitting Proposals')}}

<p>In order to carry out your own research at the SAFE Project, we require a short proposal explaining what it is you want to do and how you expect to do it. This proposal will be placed on our website as part of the science overview, allowing incoming researchers to see what research is currently underway as well as what research is likely to start up in the near future. The workflow for the process is show below:</p>

{{=IMG(_src=URL('static','images/Project_Approval.png'), _width='100%')}}

{{=H3(approval_icons['Draft'], ' Create a new draft proposal')}}

<p>First, you will need to {{=A('register on this website', _href=URL('user','register'))}} and check you understand our  {{=A('research requirements', _href=URL('info','requirements'))}} and {{=A('data policy', _href=URL('info','data_policy'))}}.</p>

<p>Before submitting a project, you <strong>must</strong> look carefully through the {{=A('existing projects', _href=URL('projects','projects'))}} to check whether similar research has already been conducted, is in progress or has been approved to occur in the future. The review process (see below) is primarily intended to ensure that research at SAFE does not not duplicate existing effort and collects data that will be comparable across projects.</p>

<p>Next, fill in and submit the {{=A('online submission form', _href=URL('projects','project_details'))}}. </P>
<ul>
<li>You will first be asked to provide a description of the research rationale and methods, along with some other vital information about ethical approval, any destructive sampling and project resource use.</li>
<li>When you save the draft, you will automatically be added as <strong>project coordinator</strong> and sent an email with a link to the project proposal webpage</li>
<li>You will now also be able to add other members, who also must be registered on the website. You can add more project coordinators, but note that they will be able to edit project proposals and add research visits - it is better to have a small admin team!</li>
<li>
<p>Please note that all international researchers looking to work in Malaysia are <strong>required to have a local collaborator</strong> as a project member.</p>
<p>For a list of current local collaborators see the {{=A('Contacts page', _href= URL('people','contacts', vars={'group':'Malaysian Collaborators'}))}} for local collaborators. Please note this list is not exhaustive nor restrictive, and the researchers listed here are not obliged to work with you. You are encouraged to seek out appropriate collaborators within Sabah that have the expertise and interest needed to support your project.</p>
</li>
<li>At this point, you will also be able to add linked projects - these can be any existing project that you think is addressing related research topics. These are likely to be run by the researchers who are most interested in making sure that you are doing comparable research, so identifying links early is important.</li>
</ul>

{{=H3(approval_icons['Submitted'], ' Submit your proposal')}}

<p>Once you have completed your draft, added all your project members and linked any similar projects, you can save and submit your draft proposal from the project details page. You will get an email confirming the proposal has been submitted. Note that you cannot make further changes to a submitted proposal until it has been either approved or sent back for resubmission.</p>

<p>At this point, an administrator will look over your proposal. If there are obvious problems with the proposal - such as a lack of detail on the research or the research team - then the proposal may immediately be sent back to you for resubmission. Otherwise, your proposal will be put into review.</p>

{{=H3(approval_icons['In Review'], ' Project proposal review process')}}

<p>Proposals submitted by Malaysian researchers will be assessed by the Maliau Basin Management Committee. All other proposals will be assessed using a peer review system:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your proposal will be sent to the project coordinators of all currently active or planned projects and all projects that completed within the last year.</li>
	<li>There will be a ten day period in which the reviewers can voice any objections, comments or concerns.</li>
	<li> If no problems are raised in this time, then your project will be approved.</li>
	<li> If there are any conflicts or objections arise your proposal will then be sent to the {{=A('SAFE Science Advisory Committee', _href=URL('people','contacts', vars={'group':'Science Advisory Committee'}))}} to review the proposal and the issues raised. The committee may then either approve the project or send it back to you for amendment and resubmission.</li>
</ul>

<p>By having a peer review system we are giving other researchers who may be interested in similar fields to yours to become aware of your work and to get in touch to share ideas, experiences etc. Also once your project is approved you will be added to the peer review email list. In addition where possible, we will either provide access to data that has already been collected and which may help support your research, or provide you with the contact details of researchers who hold data of that nature.</p>

{{=H3(approval_icons['Resubmit'], ' Resubmitting proposals')}}

<p>If your project is sent back for resubmission, you will be able to open a new draft of the proposal to amend. The website administrators and project reviewers will provide constructive comments on projects that are sent back for resubmission and you will need to address these comments carefully in your revised version. </p>

{{=H3(approval_icons['Approved'], ' Approved proposals')}}

<p>Congratulations on getting approval to work at the SAFE Project. We hope you have a fantastic time working at the project and that you will do some fantastic science.</p> 
<p>Please do <strong>keep your project description</strong> up-to-date: you will now be able to create a new draft of your proposal to update your plans. These updates will still be looked over by an administrator before the new version is approved. If you are only making minor changes then they may be approved without further review but <strong>major changes may be subject to re-review</strong> using the same process.
