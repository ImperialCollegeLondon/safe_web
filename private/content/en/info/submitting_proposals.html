{{=H2('Submitting Proposals')}}

<p>We require a short proposal explaining what it is you want to do and how you expect to do it. This proposal will be placed on our website as part of the science overview, allowing incoming researchers to see what research is currently underway as well as what research is likely to start up in the near future. To create a proposal, please fill in and submit the online submission form. Please include the names and email addresses of all participants. Please also inform us if you intend to conduct any destructive sampling. On submission, a copy of your proposal will be sent to the first email address you provide.</p>

<p>Proposals submitted by Malaysian researchers will be assessed by the Maliau Basin Management Committee. All other proposals will be assessed using a peer review system, in that they will be sent to everyone currently carrying out research at the SAFE site. There will be a ten day period in which the reviewers can voice any objections, comments or concerns, if none are received in this time your project will be approved. If any conflicts or objections arise your proposal will be sent to the SAFE Science Advisory Committee to rule on.</p>

<p>Please note that all international researchers looking to work in Malaysia are required to have a local collaborator (See Research permits). Please list your Malaysian collaborator as one of the researchers on your proposal.</p>

<p>By having a peer review system we are giving other researchers who may be interested in similar fields to yours to become aware of your work and to get in touch to share ideas, experiences etc. Also once your project is approved you will be added to the peer review email list. In addition where possible, we will either provide access to data that has already been collected and which may help support your research, or provide you with the contact details of researchers who hold data of that nature.</p>
