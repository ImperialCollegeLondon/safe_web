<OL>

<LI>{{=A(B('Check requirements'), _href=URL('info','requirements'))}}</LI>

<p>Before starting, check the requirements we make of researchers working at SAFE, including our data policy. You will need to agree to meet these conditions before being given permission to work at the project sites.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Register as a user'), _href=URL('info','requirements'))}}</LI>
	
<p>You will need to register and log in to use this website to propose and arrange research at SAFE. You can sign up {{=A('here', _href=URL('user','register'))}}.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Submit a proposal'), _href=URL('info','submitting_proposals'))}}</LI>
	
<p>Submit a short proposal explaining what it is you want to do and how you expect to do it.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Obtain research permits'), _href=URL('info','requirements'))}}</LI>

<p>When your proposal has been approved, it is up to you to obtain the necessary permissions to conduct that research.</p>

<p>It is <strong>essential that all non-Malaysian scientists working at SAFE obtain approval</strong> from the Sabah Biodiversity Centre and Maliau Basin Management Committee BEFORE commencing field work.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Check costs'), _href=URL('info','costs'))}}</LI>

<p>Both the SAFE Project and the Maliau Basin Field Studies Centre have facilities and research infrastructure that can be used to support your work.  These, obviously, come with a cost and you should budget for those.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Research visit planning'), _href=URL('info','costs'))}}</LI>

<p>Once you have all your research approval in place, please contact the Deputy Scientific Coordinator at least one month before you intend to travel to the field to discuss logistics.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Health and safety information'), _href=URL('info','costs'))}}</LI>

<p>Before arriving in the field, you will need to provide our field team with basic information about yourself and your plans, including insurance and emergency contacts and any medical conditions that might impact your safety in the field.</p>

<LI>{{=A(B('Biosecurity'), _href=URL('info','costs'))}}</LI>

<p>When you come to the field, we expect you to comply with out biosecurity protocols, designed to protect the ecosystem in which we operate.</p>
