{{=H2('Safe Requirements')}}

<p>We have two <strong>strict</strong> requirements of researchers wishing to work on the SAFE Project:</p>

<OL>
<LI><strong>Data sharing</strong></LI>
<p>We require researchers to deposit a copy of all data they generate from working at the SAFE Project into a centralised database. We also require that the data is accompanied with a completed metadata form to aid the interpretation of data. The SAFE Project data policy can be found here, and the protocols we use for creating metadata in the appropriate format are here.</p>

<LI><strong>Research outputs</strong></LI>
<p>We require researchers to keep us informed of any scientific outputs they generate, including all published papers, theses, conference presentations and media coverage. For all written outputs, we expect you to send us an electronic copy for our project archive.</p>

</OL>

{{=H3('Sampling regimes')}}

<p>In addition, we <strong>strongly</strong> encourage all researchers to design their sampling to conform with that of the central project (Sampling design). This central project design has a nested structure that allows for the fact that different ecological patterns and processes will operate at different spatial scales and should therefore be observed at different spatial scales.</p>

<p>There are several logistical and scientific advantages to using the central project sampling design. Most obviously, we have marked and cut trails running to and between these sampling points, saving you the trouble of having to mark and cut your own. A second advantage is that it will make it easier for you to take advantage of data already held in the central database; those data will almost certainly have been collected using this design.</p>

<p>The SAFE Project covers a large area and many people do not sample at all sites. We try to focus research into a subset of the blocks to maximise the potential for researchers to support each other by collecting complementary data. These focussed blocks were selected on the basis of ease and reliability of access, and to encompass a wide range of variation in forest condition and fragmentation. The blocks selected are:</p>
