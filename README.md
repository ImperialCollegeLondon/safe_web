# SAFE website #

This is the bitbucket repository for the code underlying the SAFE website. The web application is written using the [web2py](http://web2py.com/) framework and is intended to work with the same database backend as the SAFE Earthcape database.

It is currently not fully running on any externally available IP address, although a version is running on pythonanywhere: [https://davidorme.pythonanywhere.com/SAFE_web/default/index](https://davidorme.pythonanywhere.com/SAFE_web/default/index)
