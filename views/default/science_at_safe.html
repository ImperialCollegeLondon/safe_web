<h1>Science at SAFE</h1>

<p>We are holding a Science at SAFE meeting at Imperial College London, Silwood Park Campus from the 26th - 28th April 2019. The overarching aims for the meeting will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li> 
		to summarise the research done so far at SAFE, 
	</li>
	<li>
		to review how that research covers the major components of tropical forest ecosystems, and
	</li>
	<li>
		to identify gaps and opportunities for future research.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research presentations</h3>

<p>On Tuesday 26th April, we will hold four sessions of five talks (10 minute talks with 2 minutes for questions). We have a preference for talks that will provide an overview of research in a particular area, but proposals for talks on any research at SAFE are welcomed. Poster boards will also have be available and we will have a poster session during the day.</p>

<p>We aim for a balance of early-career and established researchers in these presentations.</p>

<h3>Research workshops</h3>

<p>Wednesday 27th (all day) and Thursday 28th (morning only) April will be devoted to research workshops and we invite proposals for workshop topics. We have a preference for holistic topics that aim to establish what is known about broad components of the tropical forest ecosystem and what the data and research priorities are for gaps in our understanding.</p>

<p>We initially propose the following ecosystem components &emdash topic proposals that set out where and why this is partially or utterly flawed are equally welcome:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Climate and microclimate</li>
<li>Hydrology</li>
<li>Biogeochemical cycling</li>
<li>Soil processes</li>
<li>Stoichiometry</li>
<li>Primary production</li>
<li>Decomposition processes</li>
<li>Terrestrial animal responses</li>
<li>Aquatic animal responses</li>
<li>Trophic structure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary session</h3>

<p>On the afternoon of Thursday 28th, we will hold a plenary session to present the outputs of the research workshops and to provide an overview of current research at SAFE and opportunities for future directions.</p>


<h3>Data workshops</h3>

<p>Throughout the meeting, we will be providing support for researchers who are preparing to submit data collected at SAFE into our <a href='https://zenodo.org/communities/safe'>dataset repository</a>. If you have data to submit, there will never be a better opportunity to get help in cleaning and formatting your data!</p>

<p>We will also be demonstrating prototype tools for accessing the data repository and linking datasets across research projects at SAFE.</p>

<h3>Registration and proposals</h3>

<p>To register your interest in the meeting, please email Olivia Daniel (<a href='mailto:info@safeproject.net'>info@safeproject.net</a>). If you would like to present a poster or talk at the meeting please include a title and abstract in your message. If you have a proposal for a workshop topic, please provide a title, an abstract and suggestions of other researchers who you would like to participate.
</p>


<p>
	The deadline for registration is Friday 1st March.
</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>We will need to charge participants to cover the costs of refreshments and the like during the meeting. We expect this to be in the region of Â£50 but will confirm costs shortly.</p>
