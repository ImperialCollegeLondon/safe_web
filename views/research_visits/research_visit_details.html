{{=H2('Research visit proposals')}}


<p>We have a new system for researchers who want to come to work in the field at the SAFE Project. This is to help us better organise the resources available and to encourage researchers to align field work to make it more efficient and collaborative.</p>

<p>You will have to use this system to provide a detailed plan of your field visit. We will need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>when</strong> the team will be in the field and what research will be done,</li>
<li><strong>which researchers</strong> will be coming to the field,</li>
<li>what <strong>accomodation</strong> you will need,</li>
<li>what <strong>transfers</strong> you will need and</li>
<li>if you will need <strong>RA support</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<H3>Approval process</H3>

<p>You will need to get approval for your research visit before you come to the field. In order to get approval you will need to provide:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>at least <u>two weeks</u> notice</strong> of the research visit, and</li>
<li><strong>full details of the field team and resources</strong> as described above.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your proposal does not provide this information, <strong>we will not approve the research visit</strong>. If your visit proposal has not been approved, no preparations will have been made for you and <strong>you must not come to the field</strong>.</p>

<h4>Proposals not using SAFE RAs and transfers</h4>

<p>We will generally send back proposals that do not contain any requests for transfers or research assistant time. This is because we want to make sure that we understand exactly what support you need and that you have a complete plan.</p>

<p>However not all visits need RA support and some groups (such as the BALI and Lombok consortia) have access to their own RAs or transport. If this is the case, then request your accommodation here and add a brief note to your visit description explaining that you'll be using your own transport or RAs. If you're on a BALI/LOMBOK project, do make sure to contact Unding to request that support!</p>

<h4>Visiting at short notice</h4>

<p>If you urgently need to come to the field within the next two weeks, then you will not be able to use the system below. You must directly email the Science Director (<a href="mailto:r.ewers@imperial.ac.uk">Dr. Rob Ewers</a>), providing all the details above, who will make a decision about whether to allow your visit. This can only be approved by the Science Director, so <strong>do not</strong> contact the Deputy Coordinator or other staff to request visits at short notice.</p>

<p>If you do request a visit at short notice, we are likely to charge <strong>a late booking fee</strong>, unless the circumstances were clearly unavoidable.</p>


<h3>How to use the system</h3>

<p>First, you will need to give a quick summary of the visit dates and purpose. Once you have done that, a set of forms will appear that allow you to provide the rest of your visit details, along with an explanation of how to use the system. </p>

<p>An example of using the system can be found on the SAFE wiki along with further information:
<a href='https://www.safeproject.net/dokuwiki/working_at_safe/research_visit_proposals'>https://www.safeproject.net/dokuwiki/working_at_safe/research_visit_proposals</a></p>

<h4>Sabah Public Holidays</h4>

<p>Note that we have have highlighted the main Sabah public holidays in all the date selection calendars. Please try and avoid requesting transfers and RA support around these dates - SAFE will still be running but we may be short of staff!</p>
