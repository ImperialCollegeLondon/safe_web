	<div class='alert alert-info'>The gazeteer is a work in progress - the riparian tree plots still need to be added</div>
	
	<p>The map below shows the primary fieldwork locations used in the SAFE Project. These core locations provide a set of standard names that can be used to record where data is collected, although researchers will typically also collect GPS coordinates to provide details of local spatial structure in their sampling.</p>
	
	<p>We also provide a <a href={{=URL('static','/files/gis/gazeteer.zip')}}>zip file</a> containing this data in GeoJSON format: this single file contains all the polygons, lines and points in the gazeteer and is widely readable in GIS applications</p>
	
	<p>The searchable table below the map will update the set of locations shown on the map. It also provides a GPX download button to return the coordinates of selected sampling locations for use in a GPS. We provide <strong>the polygon centroid</strong> as a GPX waypoint for polygons, since these locations are simple enough that the centroid lies within the sampling location. We deliberately <strong>do not provide any centroid </strong> for linear sampling locations, such as riparian transects. There is no guarantee that the line centroid will fall on the line - use the GPX waypoints for the individual stations on a transect instead.</p>
