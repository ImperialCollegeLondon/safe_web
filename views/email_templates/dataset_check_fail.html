<p>Dear {{=name}},</p>


<p>Thank you for submitting your dataset '{{=filename}}' to the SAFE website</p>

<p>The dataset has failed the metadata and format checking. The report at the bottom of this email gives a list of the issues found: please fix up the issues with the dataset and resubmit it.</p>

<p>You can also see the dataset record online, including the check report, at this link:</p>

<p>{{=dataset_url}}</p>


<p>We do really appreciate the time and effort it takes to add our required metadata - it is an important part of making sure that all the data collected at SAFE is safely archived and well described.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The SAFEWeb team</p>
<p>On behalf of Rob Ewers</p>
