<p> Current news posts are shown below. You can use the links to add a new post or edit an existing post. </p>

<p>In the edit view, there is a button that allows you to hide news posts from public view. You will always be able to see invisible posts here (and unhide them). This allows us to retire posts without permanently deleting them from the database.</p>

<p> <strong> Remember that your post will immediately go live on the internet!</strong></p>
