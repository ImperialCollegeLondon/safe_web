<div class='alert alert-info'>This is a system in development! Talk to David Orme if you're interested in testing this out...</div>

<p>It is a requirement of working at SAFE that you provide us with a copy of your data. We will validate your dataset and then publish it on Zenodo, which will provide a permanent home for your data and assign it a permanent DOI.  This page allows you to submit a dataset and follow the progress through to publication.</p>

<p>This submission process only accepts datasets stored in Microsoft Excel files - please contact us about other kinds of data. You will need to format your file to provide some simple metadata and detailed instructions on the file format can be found <a href='https://www.safeproject.net/dokuwiki/working_at_safe/data_submission_format'>here</a>. We realise it takes time and effort to get the data formatted correctly but the information you add is vital to make sure that we can archive your data properly and make it easy for future researchers to find it and benefit from it.</p>

<p>Remember that the information you provide will become part of the permenanent record on the published dataset - you should make the data and description as clear and informative as possible. Note that the metadata description of your dataset will be visible in Zenodo as soon as it is published, but you can choose to embargo your data for up to two years. The data itself will only be accesible after the embargo period has expired.</p>

	<li>If the file has failed format checking, then click on the 'View details' for the check report. Once you've fixed any problems, come back and upload a new version.
