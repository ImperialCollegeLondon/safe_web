{{=H2('Submit a dataset')}}

<p>This page allows you to submit data collected as part of the SAFE project to our archives. This page only accepts datasets stored in Microsoft Excel files and you will need to format your file to provide some simple metadata.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions on the file format can be found here: {{=URL()}}. It will take a little to get the data formatted but the information you add is vital to make sure that we can archive your data properly and allow future researchers to use it.</p>
