<h2>Merge projects</h2>

<p>The form below allows admin users to merge two projects. Outputs and datasets associated with the <strong>source</strong> project are transferred to the <strong>destination</strong> project. The source project page is still accessible but it will be marked as having been merged to another project.</p>
